## What Is an Action

> An action is an object describing the intent to change the state.  
> It tells Redux **what happened**, but does not define **exactly how to update the state** — the reducer does that.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Action's Role in Redux**

- An action is the only way to initiate a state change.
    
- It formalizes an event: a user click, a server response, a system update, etc.
    
- The reducer reads the action and decides how to react to it.
    

#### **Action Structure**

An action is a simple object with properties:

- **type** — a mandatory string value identifying the event.
    
- **payload** — data associated with the event (optional).
    
- Additional metadata (if needed): `error`, `meta`.
    

Conceptual form example:

```js
{
  type: 'todos/add',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```

#### **Why type is Critically Important**

- The reducer uses `type` to select a logic branch.
    
- The type should be stable, readable, and unique.
    

#### **Why an Action Should Not Contain Logic**

- It only describes the fact of an event.
    
- The logic for changing the state is in the reducer.
    
- Asynchronous or side logic is handled by middleware (e.g., Thunk).

### Important Notes

- An action is a synchronous object. Asynchrony is implemented through middleware.
    
- In the Redux Toolkit, actions are generated automatically via `createSlice`.
    
- The action remains the central entity of the Redux flow: **without an action, there is no dispatch**.
