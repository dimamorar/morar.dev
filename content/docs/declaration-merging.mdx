> Declaration merging is a TypeScript mechanism that allows combining several declarations with the same name into a single extended type. The compiler "merges" them, combining properties, methods, or function signatures into a unified definition.

---

### 🧩 Main Idea

- If **multiple declarations with the same identifier** exist in the code, TypeScript automatically merges them.
- This applies to:
    - **interfaces**
    - **namespaces**
    - **functions and classes**, if they are declared compatibly with a namespace.

---

### 🧩 Example: Merging Interfaces

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
}

const person: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Anna",
};
```

- Both definitions are combined:
    
    ```tsx
    interface User {
      id: number;
      name: string;
    }
    ```
    

> This is convenient for extending library types without directly editing them.

---

### 🧩 Example: Namespace + Function/Class

- You can add properties to functions or classes via a namespace.

```tsx
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

namespace greet {
  export const version = "1.0";
}

console.log(greet.version); // ✅ "1.0"
```

- The namespace "merges" with the function, creating a **hybrid entity**.

---

### 🧩 Example: Extending Types from Libraries

```tsx
interface Window {
  myCustomVar: string;
}

window.myCustomVar = "Hello!"; // ✅ now TypeScript "knows" about the new property
```

> Declaration merging allows adding custom types to global objects or library APIs (via .d.ts files).

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Declaration merging = **combining multiple definitions into one**.
- Most commonly used for:
    - extending existing types or APIs,
    - adding types to libraries without typings,
    - creating hybrid types (function + namespace).
- A powerful mechanism that allows extending code **without losing compatibility or overrides**.
