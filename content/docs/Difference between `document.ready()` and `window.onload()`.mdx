## Difference between `document.ready()` and `window.onload()`

> Both methods are used to execute code after the page has loaded,
> 
> 
> but they differ in the **timing of the event**.
> 
> `document.ready()` fires when the **DOM** is loaded,
> 
> while `window.onload()` fires when **all page resources** (images, styles, fonts, etc.) are loaded.

### 🧩 `document.ready()` / `DOMContentLoaded`

- Fires when the browser has **built the DOM tree**,
    
    but external resources (images, styles) may still be loading.
    
- Used for initializing the interface and scripts
    
    that only require the ready DOM structure.
    
- Happens **earlier** than `window.onload()`,
    
    so the page becomes interactive faster.
    

Modern syntax (without jQuery):

```jsx
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", callback);

```

### 🧩 `window.onload()`

- Fires when **all page content has loaded**,
    
    including images, styles, fonts, iframes, and other resources.
    
- Used when work with elements
    
    depending on external data is required (for example, calculating image sizes).
    
- Happens **later** than `DOMContentLoaded`.

Modern syntax:

```jsx
window.addEventListener("load", callback);

```

### ⚖️ Key Differences

| Feature | `document.ready()` / `DOMContentLoaded` | `window.onload()` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trigger Timing** | After DOM construction | After all resources load |
| **Wait for External Files** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Typical Scenarios** | UI initialization, DOM manipulations | Working with images, layout |
| **Response Speed** | Faster | Slower |
| **Modern Analogue** | `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)` | `window.addEventListener('load', ...)` |

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `DOMContentLoaded` makes the page interactive **earlier** than `load`.
- For most UI tasks, `DOMContentLoaded` is used.
- `window.onload` is useful if you need to wait for the **full content load**.
- Both events can be used together if different parts of the logic require different stages of document readiness.
