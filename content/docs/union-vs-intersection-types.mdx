> Union types (|) allow a variable to take one of several types, while **intersection types (`&`)** combine several types into **one shared type** that contains properties of all components. They represent two opposite ways of combining types in TypeScript.

### 🧩 Union Types (`|`)

- Means: **"either this type or another"**.
- The value must match at least one of the listed types.
- Used for values with several valid forms.

```tsx
let id: string | number;
id = 123;
id = "ABC123";
```

- The type can be checked using **type narrowing**:

```tsx
function printId(id: string | number) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    console.log(id.toFixed(2));
  }
}
```

### 🧩 Intersection Types (`&`)

- Means: **"and this type and another at the same time"**.
- Combines properties of several types into a new, extended type.

```tsx
interface Person {
  name: string;
}
interface Employee {
  id: number;
}

type Worker = Person & Employee;

const user: Worker = {
  name: "Olha",
  id: 101,
};
```

- The object must contain **all properties** from both types.

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **Union (`|`)** → selection of one of several types.
- **Intersection (`&`)** → combining several types into one.
- Union is suitable for **alternative options**, intersection — for **object composition**.
- Together they make the TypeScript type system extremely flexible.
