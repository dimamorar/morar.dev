## **How Server Actions differ from API Routes in Next.js**

> Server Actions are direct server functions that React calls without an HTTP request.  
> API Routes are full-fledged HTTP endpoints that serve clients, mobile applications, or any third-party systems.  
> Server Actions are suitable for internal mutations in the UI, while API Routes are for integrations and public APIs.

### Technical Explanation

#### Server Actions

- Executed **directly on the server**, without the HTTP protocol.
    
- Called from:
    
    - forms (`action={fn}`),
        
    - code (import and call).
        
- Intended for **internal mutations**: changing a profile, creating records, updating state.
    
- Not accessible from the outside (no public endpoint).
    
- Do not add JS to the client bundle.
    
- Have access to the database, cookies, and server secrets.
    

**Suitable for:**  
UI interactions, CRUD inside the application, forms.

#### API Routes (Route Handlers)

- Implement **full-fledged HTTP endpoints**.
    
- Called from any client: browser, mobile application, backend services.
    
- Needed when:
    
    - an external API is needed;
        
    - there is integration with third-party systems;
        
    - methods need to be controlled (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
        
- Have all HTTP aspects:
    
    - statuses, headers, CORS, cookies, streaming responses.
    

**Minimal GET example:**

```js
export function POST(request) {
  return Response.json({ ok: true });
}
```

### Key Differences

#### Protocol

- Server Actions → **React protocol, without HTTP**
    
- API Routes → **HTTP API**
    

#### Accessibility
- Server Actions → internal to the UI
- API Routes → accessible to external clients

#### Performance
- Server Actions → minimal overhead, no fetch
- API Routes → network request, full HTTP cycle

#### Purpose
- Server Actions → forms, local mutations
- API Routes → public APIs, integrations, webhooks
