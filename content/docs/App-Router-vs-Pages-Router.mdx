## **App Router in Next.js and its differences from Pages Router**

> App Router is a modern RSC-oriented architecture in Next.js that organizes the interface through segments, layouts, and streaming rendering.  
> It minimizes client-side JavaScript and moves most of the logic to the server.  
> Pages Router is the previous model that relied on client-side React and separate lifecycle functions for SSR/SSG.

### Technical Explanation

#### App Router (directory `/app`)

- Built on **React Server Components**, where the server is the source of UI.
    
- Has a hierarchical system of files: **layout.js**, **page.js**, **loading.js**, **error.js**, **not-found.js**, **route.js**.
    
- Supports **streaming**, **partial rendering**, **parallel routes**, **intercepting routes**, and **Server Actions**.
    
- Unified data fetching model via **fetch() with caching and revalidation**.
    
- Smaller volume of client JS, less hydration.
    

#### Pages Router (directory `/pages`)

- Works through **Client Components** + SSR/SSG in the form of `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`.
    
- Uses global files `_app.js`, `_document.js` for composition.
    
- Does not support RSC, streaming, layout segments, or Server Actions.
    
- Hydration is more complex, bundle is larger.
    

#### Main Architectural Differences

- App Router is **server-first**, Pages Router is **client-first**.
    
- App Router forms the UI through a **layout tree**, Pages Router — through a global container.
    
- App Router automates caching and rendering, Pages Router — no.
    
- App Router significantly reduces runtime on the client.
