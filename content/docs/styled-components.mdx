> Styled-components is a CSS-in-JS library for React that allows describing styles through template literals and creating "styled components."  
> It generates unique classes under the hood and provides full style encapsulation and dynamic styling via props.

### Core Concept

- Styles are described as `styled.element` or `styled(Component)`.
    
- A unique CSS class is generated for each styled component.
    
- Dynamic styles are formed based on props or the theme.
    
- Supports SSR but requires additional configuration.
    

### Advantages

- Familiar CSS syntax without the need to write JS objects.
    
- Full isolation: styles do not "leak" between components.
    
- Powerful theming support via `<ThemeProvider>`.
    
- Easy to create component variants (`styled(Button)`).
    

### Disadvantages

- **Runtime style generation** → potential performance issues.
    
- SSR requires special configuration (e.g., in Next.js).
    
- Not suitable for very large projects where maximum render speed is critical.
    

### Examples of Use

#### Minimal Example

```jsx
const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 8px 12px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: ${(p) => (p.primary ? 'blue' : 'gray')};
  color: white;
`;
```

### Typical Use Cases
- Projects with active theming and variable UI components.
- Design systems where components are logically combined with their styles.
- Components whose style significantly depends on props.

### Important Notes
- For Next.js (especially App Router), CSS Modules or solutions with build-time compilation (e.g., Vanilla Extract) are often recommended.
- Styled-components is popular, but in interviews, an understanding of its **trade-offs**, especially performance, is expected.
