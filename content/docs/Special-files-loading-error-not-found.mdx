## **How `loading.js`, `error.js`, and `not-found.js` work in App Router routes**

> These special files define the behavior of a segment during loading, an error, or the absence of a resource.  
> They integrate with React Suspense, allowing streaming rendering and control over UX in different states.  
> App Router handles them at the segment level, forming a predictable hierarchy of fallback states.

### Technical Explanation

#### `loading.js`

- Called automatically when a segment or child segment **is not yet ready** (loading data or rendering RSC).
    
- Works through **React Suspense boundaries** that Next.js creates around segments.
    
- Does not block rendering of the entire layout — shows a partial UI.
    

**Example:**

```jsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <p>Loading...</p>;
}
```

---

#### `error.js`

- Rendered if a **server or rendering error** occurs within the segment.
    
- Has a special interface with a required `error` prop and a `reset` function.
    
- `reset()` restarts the segment for a retry.
    

**Example:**

```jsx
"use client";

export default function Error({ error, reset }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Error occurred.</p>
      <button onClick={reset}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ❗ `error.js` is always a Client Component because it contains a UI with interaction.

---

#### `not-found.js`

- Called when a segment did not find a resource:
    
    - manually via `notFound()`,
        
    - automatically in the absence of data.
        
- Supports a **segment-specific** 404 page (at any level).
    

**Example:**

```jsx
export default function NotFound() {
  return <h1>Not found</h1>;
}
```

### Priority Order

1. `loading.js` — during loading.
    
2. `error.js` — on error.
    
3. `not-found.js` — in the absence of data or resource.
