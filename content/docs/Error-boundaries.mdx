## Error boundaries — how they catch render errors

### 🧩 What is an Error Boundary

- Error Boundary is a **React container component** implementing error handling methods.
- It catches errors **only in child components**, but not in itself.
- Works for errors:
    - during rendering,
    - in lifecycle methods,
    - in constructors of descendants.

---

### 🧩 Implementation in Class Components

Error Boundary must implement at least one of two methods:

1. **`static getDerivedStateFromError(error)`** — updates state upon an error.
2. **`componentDidCatch(error, info)`** — logs the error or sends it to the server.

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.error('Caught by boundary:', error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

```

Usage:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Profile />
</ErrorBoundary>

```

### 🧩 Error Boundaries in Functional Components

Currently, Hooks **do not provide a direct analogue** of Error Boundary.

However, you can use:

- **built-in `<ErrorBoundary>`** from React 18+ (experimental),
- or a wrapper based on `react-error-boundary` (library by Kent C. Dodds).

```jsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';

<ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
  <UserList />
</ErrorBoundary>

```

---

### 🧩 Limitations

Error Boundaries **do not catch errors**:

- inside event handlers (`onClick`, `onSubmit`);
- in asynchronous callbacks (setTimeout, Promises);
- in server-side rendering (SSR);
- for errors inside the Error Boundaries themselves.

For these cases, use:

- `try...catch` inside the logic,
- global listeners (`window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`).

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Error Boundaries protect the UI from critical errors in child components.
- Implemented through `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` methods.
- Do not catch errors in asynchronous or event contexts.
- Serve as an **"emergency buffer"**, increasing application stability.
