> keyof is a TypeScript operator that returns a union of all keys of an object or interface as string literals. It is used for creating **type-safe operations on object properties**.

---

### 🧩 Core Idea

- `keyof` extracts **type field names** as a set of values (string literals).
- Useful when creating generic functions that work with dynamic keys.

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type UserKeys = keyof User;
// "id" | "name" | "age"
```

---

### 🧩 Usage in functions

You can constrain an argument to accept **only real keys** of an object:

```tsx
function getValue<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const user = { id: 1, name: "Olha" };

const name = getValue(user, "name"); // ✅ string
const invalid = getValue(user, "email"); // ❌ Error: "email" does not exist in type
```

- This ensures **full type safety when accessing properties**.

---

### 🧩 Combinations with other operators

- `keyof` is often used with `typeof`, `in`, `extends` to build **dynamic types**:

```tsx
const user = { id: 1, name: "Olha" };
type Keys = keyof typeof user; // "id" | "name"
```

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `keyof` creates a union of property names of a type.
- Allows writing **generic functions** that work only with existing keys.
- A primary tool for building **flexible types and utility constructs** (e.g., `Pick`, `Omit`).
