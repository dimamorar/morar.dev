## Strict Mode — purpose and double render behavior in dev mode

> StrictMode is a React tool for identifying potential problems in code.

> It does not affect production behavior but helps detect unsafe side effects, incorrect hooks, and deprecated patterns during development.

---

### 🧩 What Strict Mode Does

- Enabled using a wrapper component:
    
    ```jsx
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>
    
    ```
    
- Activates additional checks and warnings **only in dev mode**.
- Does not appear in the DOM and does not change the visual behavior of the application.

---

### 🧩 Main Checks

- Double invocation of lifecycles and hooks (mount → unmount → mount).
- Identification of side effects outside of `useEffect`.
- Verification of correct resource cleanup in `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`.
- Warnings when using deprecated methods (`componentWillMount`, `findDOMNode`, `legacy context`).

---

### 🧩 Double Render (double invoke)

- React **intentionally calls the component twice** when mounting in Strict Mode.
- Purpose — to check that:
    - side effects are not performed outside of `useEffect`,
    - components correctly handle repeated state creation,
    - there are no resource leaks during mounting/unmounting.

```jsx
function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Effect runs');
    return () => console.log('Cleanup');
  }, []);
  return <div>Strict Mode check</div>;
}

```

**In Dev Mode:**

```
Effect runs
Cleanup
Effect runs

```

**In Prod Mode:**

```
Effect runs
```

---

### 🧩 When to Use

- Always wrap the root of the application in `<React.StrictMode>` during development.
- Disable only when integrating with third-party libraries that do not support double rendering.

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Strict Mode works **only in dev mode**.
- Helps identify unsafe or uncleansed side effects.
- Double rendering is a **diagnostic measure**, not an error.
- Its goal is to ensure the **purity, predictability, and safety of React components**.
