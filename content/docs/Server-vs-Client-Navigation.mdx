## **Difference between server navigation and client navigation in Next.js (13–15)**

> In Next.js, navigation can be performed on the server or on the client depending on the type of components and the way of transition.  
> Server navigation allows streaming and partial replacement of RSC payload without loading unnecessary JS.  
> Client navigation is needed only for Client Components and interactive logic.

### Technical Explanation

#### Server Navigation (App Router default)

- Used when navigating **between RSC pages or segments**.
    
- React receives **new RSC payload** from the server.
    
- No full reload → React only updates the changed segments.
    

Characteristics:

- minimal amount of network data;
    
- streaming via Suspense;
    
- layout preservation without re-mounting;
    
- no client-side JS for navigation.
    

**Used automatically** with `Link` between RSC pages.

#### Client Navigation

Needed when:

- the page contains Client Components;
    
- navigation is called via `router.push()` in the client;
    
- there is interactive logic, dependencies on state, effects.
    

In fact:

- Next.js performs navigation in the browser, without a new SSR.
    
- But it also loads the **updated RSC payload** from the server.
    
- Client-side JS continues to work without a full reset.

#### Main Differences

| Feature | Server Navigation | Client Navigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Triggered from | RSC | Client Components |
| JS on client | None | Requires JS in browser |
| Uses streaming | Yes | No streaming in client-only transitions |
| Payload size | Smaller | Depends on number of client components |
| Preserves layout | Yes | Yes |

#### Important Nuance

Navigation always **loads a new RSC payload**, but:

- in Server Navigation, this is done by the server without JS;
    
- in Client Navigation, this is done by the browser using JS.
