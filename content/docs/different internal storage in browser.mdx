## Different Internal Storage in Browser

> Web browsers provide several mechanisms for storing data on the client side.
> 
> 
> The main types: **Cookies**, **LocalStorage**, **SessionStorage**, and **IndexedDB** — differ in volume, lifespan, access scope, and purpose.

### 🧩 1. Cookies

- Store small **key-value** pairs automatically sent with every HTTP request.
- Used for **authentication**, **sessions**, and **user tracking**.
- Size is limited (~4 KB).
- Lifespan is set via `expires` or `max-age`.
- Accessible from the client (via `document.cookie`) and the server.
- Not suitable for storing large or sensitive data — **automatically transmitted to the server**.

---

### 🧩 2. LocalStorage

- **Persistent storage** on the client; data is saved between sessions.
- Not sent to the server.
- Stores data **as strings**, volume is usually **5–10 MB**.
- Suitable for storing **settings, themes, tokens, data cache**.
- API: `localStorage.setItem()`, `getItem()`, `removeItem()`.

---

### 🧩 3. SessionStorage

- Similar to `LocalStorage`, but lives only **within one tab**.
- Data is deleted when the tab is closed or the page is reloaded.
- Isolated between tabs even of the same domain.
- Used for **temporary data** — form states, filters, current actions.
- API is identical to `LocalStorage`.

---

### 🧩 4. IndexedDB

- **Asynchronous object-oriented database** in the browser.
- Supports storing **structured data** (objects, arrays, binary files).
- Works through **transactions and events**.
- Allows searching by **keys and indexes**.
- Used for **offline applications**, **caching**, and **large volumes of data** (up to hundreds of megabytes).
- API is low-level, often used via wrappers (for example, `idb`).

### ⚖️ Comparison

| Storage | Volume | Lifespan | Access | Sent to Server | Data Format | Main Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cookies** | ~4 KB | Configurable (`expires`) | Client + Server | ✅ Yes | Strings | Sessions, authorization |
| **LocalStorage** | 5–10 MB | Permanent | Client only | ❌ No | Strings | Settings, cache, tokens |
| **SessionStorage** | 5–10 MB | While tab is active | Client only | ❌ No | Strings | Temporary states |
| **IndexedDB** | 100+ MB | Permanent | Client only | ❌ No | Objects | Offline, large data |

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **Cookies** — for exchanging data with the server.
- **LocalStorage** — for long-term client-side storage.
- **SessionStorage** — for temporary data within a tab.
- **IndexedDB** — for complex and large data structures.
- All mechanisms are isolated **by domain (origin)** and have security restrictions (CORS, HTTPS).
