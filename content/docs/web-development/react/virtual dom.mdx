> Virtual DOM is React's internal model representing the structure of the real DOM as a tree of JavaScript objects. It allows React to calculate the difference between UI states in memory and update the real DOM with a minimum number of operations.

### 🧩 What is Virtual DOM

- **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a tree of **React Elements** created when calling `React.createElement()` (or when using JSX).
- Each element is an **ordinary object** describing what DOM node or component should be displayed.
- Virtual DOM is not linked to the real browser DOM — it exists **only in memory** and serves as an intermediate layer for optimization.

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>;
```

After transpilation, JSX turns into:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "greeting" },
  "Hello, world!"
);
```

Result — React Element object:

```jsx
{
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
  type: 'h1',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  },
  _owner: null,
  _store: {}
}
```

### 🧩 Diffing and Reconciliation

- When state changes, React creates a **new Virtual DOM tree** and compares it with the old one.
- Comparison is performed by the **diffing** algorithm, which analyzes differences by:
  - element type (`div`, `Component`, `TextNode`);
  - positions of child elements;
  - keys (`key`) for identification.
- After analysis, React passes the differences to the **reconciliation** mechanism, which updates only the changed areas of the real DOM.

---

### 🧩 Performance

- DOM operations are expensive, operations with objects in memory are cheap.
- Virtual DOM allows:
  - performing updates in **batches (batching)**;
  - minimizing DOM access;
  - making rendering **predictable and deterministic**.

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Virtual DOM = **abstract tree of React Elements** existing in memory.
- React creates a new tree with each update and compares it with the old one.
- Only changed nodes are passed for updating in the real DOM.
- Such a mechanism ensures **high performance and clean UI architecture**.
