> Fiber Node is the primary structural unit of the Fiber architecture.  
> It is a lightweight, mutable structure that represents each component or DOM node, allowing React to perform incremental, interruptible, and prioritized rendering.

### 🧩 Core Concept of Fiber Node

- Every React element in the tree is converted into a **Fiber node**.
    
- Fiber is not an element or a component, but a **rendering unit of work**.
    
- It stores:
    
    - component information,
        
    - state,
        
    - effects,
        
    - updates,
        
    - pointers to neighboring nodes.
        

Fiber forms a **tree that React can traverse and manipulate iteratively**, rather than recursively.

### 🧩 Fiber Node Structure

Typical Fiber structure (simplified):

```js
{
  type,            // Element type (component or DOM tag)
  tag,             // Type of Fiber (Function, Class, HostComponent, etc.)
  pendingProps,    // New props for processing
  memoizedProps,   // Previous props (for comparison)
  memoizedState,   // Component state
  updateQueue,     // Update queue
  child,           // First child Fiber
  sibling,         // Next sibling Fiber
  return,          // Parent Fiber
  alternate,       // Node clone (for double-buffering)
  flags,           // Effects (Placement, Update, Deletion, Passive)
}
```

### 🧩 Pointer Tree Structure

Fiber uses **pointers like in a singly linked list**, rather than recursion.

#### Key Pointers:

- **`child`** — first child
    
- **`sibling`** — next sibling
    
- **`return`** — reference to parent
    

This allows React to:

- traverse the tree without recursion,
    
- pause rendering,
    
- return to any point,
    
- re-run work.

### 🧩 alternate: double-buffering

- Each Fiber has a clone — **`alternate`**,  
    which corresponds to the previous state of the node.
    
- React compares “current” and “work-in-progress” versions.
    
- This allows:
    
    - keeping two trees simultaneously,
        
    - not mutating the current tree,
        
    - interrupting work without damaging the UI.

### 🧩 flags: effect system

The `flags` field records effects to be executed in the commit phase:

- `Placement` — insert element into DOM
    
- `Update` — update attributes / props
        
- `Deletion` — delete node
    
- `Passive` — `useEffect`
    
- other service flags
    

This allows performing DOM operations optimally and in batches.

### 💡 Key Ideas
- Fiber Node is a React working block that replaced the recursive stack.
- It contains data about the component, state, updates, and effects.
- The pointer system allows React to pause rendering and manage the process.
- alternate provides double-buffering and safe tree transformations.
- flags define what will happen in the commit phase.
