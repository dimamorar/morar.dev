## **Hydration and Re-hydration in Next.js / React**

> Hydration is the process where the browser connects client-side JavaScript to HTML already generated by the server.  
> In App Router, hydration is applied only to Client Components, while Server Components do not require client-side JS.  
> Re-hydration occurs during RSC-payload updates or transitions when React partially connects the updated UI.

### Technical Explanation

#### Hydration (initial hydration)

- Occurs after SSR or SSG when the browser receives:
    
    1. Page HTML;
        
    2. Client Components JavaScript bundles.
        
- React reconciles the HTML structure with the React component tree and connects event handlers.
    
- **Only Client Components undergo hydration.**
    
- Server Components do not contain JS → do not hydrate.
    

Goal:

- make the UI interactive;
    
- synchronize the ready HTML with the React state in the browser.

#### Re-hydration in App Router

Re-hydration is the **reconnection or update of UI parts** when:

- Next.js receives a new **RSC payload** after navigation;
    
- partial rendering occurs via Suspense;
    
- Client Components that depend on new props require logic rebinding.
    

Important:

- not all components are redrawn;
    
- layouts preserve their state as they aren't remounted;
    
- re-hydration can be selective (partial hydration).

### How it works in App Router

- RSC → generated on the server, sent as serialized fragments.
    
- Client receives new tree parts → React updates "hydrated" and "non-hydrated" UI parts.
    
- Client Components remain responsible for interactivity.
    

Result:
- minimum JS for RSC;
- hydration occurs only on necessary elements;
- page transitions feel like an SPA but with server-side rendering.

### Key Differences
- **Hydration** → the first run of Client Components in the browser.
- **Re-hydration** → updating UI parts after receiving a new RSC payload.
- **RSC** do not hydrate at all, making their structure lighter and faster.
