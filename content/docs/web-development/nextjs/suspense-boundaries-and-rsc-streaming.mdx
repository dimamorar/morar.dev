## **Suspense boundaries and their impact on RSC streaming in Next.js**

> Suspense boundaries define UI areas that can be rendered and streamed independently of each other.  
> In App Router, Next.js automatically creates Suspense around segments, which allows showing a partial UI during loading.  
> This ensures a faster time-to-first-byte and smooth page updates.

### Technical Explanation

#### Suspense in the context of RSC

- Suspense works at the **server rendering** level, streaming ready parts of the tree as they are built.
    
- If a component or a fetch request delays rendering, Suspense shows a fallback.
    
- The RSC payload can be transmitted **step-by-step**, reducing wait time.

#### Automatic Suspense boundaries in App Router

Next.js surrounds these elements with a Suspense boundary:

- **each segment with `loading.js`**,
    
- **each nested layout**,
    
- **dynamic segments**,
    
- **partially loaded RSCs**.
    

This means:

- `loading.js` → fallback for the segment;
    
- top-level segments are not blocked by slow children.

#### Behavior during streaming

- The server sends HTML and RSC in parts.
    
- The client receives minimal HTML immediately and then loads RSC fragments.
    
- The UI updates without a full re-render, similar to "progressive rendering."

#### Suspense in Client Components

Suspense also works in client components, but without RSC streaming.  
Example:

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Chart />
</Suspense>
```

### Why this is needed
- Significantly reduces wait time for complex pages.
- Allows independent parts of the UI to render in parallel.
- Critically important for large App Router layout trees.
