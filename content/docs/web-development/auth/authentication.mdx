## **Authentication**

> A mechanism for verifying a user's identity, confirming that the client is exactly who they claim to be.
> Used to establish trust between the client and the server before granting access to protected resources.

### **Main Goal**

Authentication answers the question **"Who are you?"**.

After successful verification, the server can issue a token, a session, or otherwise confirm the user's identity.

---

### **Types of Authentication**

### 1. Basic Authentication

- Sending an `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>` header.
- Simple implementation, but **insecure without HTTPS** — the password is easy to decode.
- Usually used only for internal or temporary APIs.

### 2. Session-based Authentication

- After login, the server creates a **session** and stores it in memory or a database.
- The client receives a **cookie with a session ID**, which is sent with every request.
- Disadvantage: the server stores state → scaling requires sharing sessions.
- Advantage: possibility of forced logout (by deleting the session on the server).

### 3. Token-based Authentication

- The server issues a token (usually JWT), which the client stores and sends in the header:
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- The server **does not store state** — the token is self-contained.
- Suitable for SPA and microservices, but requires monitoring expiration and revocation of tokens.

---

### 4. OAuth 2.0 and Bearer Tokens

- OAuth 2.0 — **a framework for delegated authentication**, where a proxy server issues a `Bearer Token`.
- The token confirms the client's right to access the API.
- Used with external providers (Google, GitHub, Facebook).

---

### 5. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

- Adds a second level of verification (SMS code, TOTP, biometrics).
- Increases security even if the password is compromised.

---

### **6. Authentication Lifecycle**

1. The user enters login and password.
2. The server verifies data and generates a session or token.
3. The client stores the identifier and sends it with every request.
4. The server validates and updates as necessary (refresh flow).
