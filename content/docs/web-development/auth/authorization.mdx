### **Main Idea**

After successful authentication, the server knows *who* the user is.

Authorization determines *what they are allowed to do*: view, modify, delete, or create data.

Authorization decisions are made based on **roles**, **rights**, or **access policies**.

---

### **Main Authorization Models**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Each user is assigned a **role** (admin, editor, user).
- Each role has a set of permissions.
- Verification is performed on the principle:
    
    "If the role contains the required right — access is granted."
    
- A simple and common model.

### **2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

- The decision depends on **attributes**: user, resource, context (time, IP, device).
- A more flexible model, suitable for complex business logic.

### **3. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**

- Uses declarative **policies** (for example, in JSON format).
- The server checks rules like:
    
    *"user.role === 'manager' && resource.ownerId === user.id"*.
    
- Popular in systems with microservice architecture.

### **Web-level Authorization**

- On the client — hiding or blocking UI elements without sufficient rights.
- On the server — **strict verification** before performing any protected action.
- Verification is usually performed via middleware or a guard that analyzes:
    - JWT / Access Token (role, scope, permissions).
    - Session state.
    - Request parameters and resource.

---

### **Connection with Authentication**

- **Authentication:** confirms user identity.
- **Authorization:** determines their access level.
    
    Both stages are performed sequentially — you cannot authorize an unauthenticated user.
    

---

### **Security and Best Practices**

- Store access rights on the server, not on the client.
- Verify permissions **on every request to a protected API**.
- Use short access tokens and limited scopes.
- When roles change — **invalidate tokens** of the user.
