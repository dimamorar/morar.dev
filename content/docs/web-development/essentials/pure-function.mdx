### Properties of a Pure Function

#### Determinism

- Same input values → same result.
    
- Does not use variables that can change outside the function.
    

#### Absence of Side Effects

- Does not mutate arguments.
    
- Does not change external objects, variables, DOM, global state.
    
- Does not perform IO operations (network requests, logging, working with time, etc.).
    

#### Isolation

- Completely depends only on its arguments.
    
- The result can be cached (memoization).
    
- Easily testable because it does not require external context.
    

### Minimal Example

```js
// pure
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// impure
const addToGlobal = (x) => { globalSum += x; };
```

### Important Notes

- Pure functions are the foundation of Redux (reducers must be pure).
    
- In functional programming, they are used for predictable logic and referential transparency.
