## What Is a Thunk and Why Does It Allow Dispatching Functions

> A thunk is a wrapper function that defers the execution of logic until a certain moment.  
> In Redux, a thunk is used as an action function, allowing you to perform asynchronous operations and dispatch regular actions manually.

### Technical Explanation

#### **What a Thunk Is in a General Sense**

- A thunk is a function that returns another function.
    
- It allows "deferring" the execution of logic until it is explicitly called.
    

Concept example:  
`const thunk = () => computeLater()`

#### **Thunk in Redux**

Redux by default accepts only **object actions**.  
Thunk middleware changes the rule: if `dispatch()` receives a function, it **does not send it to the reducer**, but calls it with arguments:

```
(dispatch, getState) => { ... }
```

This allows:

- executing asynchronous code,
    
- dispatching multiple regular actions sequentially,
    
- reading the current state through `getState()`.
    

#### **Why a Thunk Can Dispatch Functions**

Because the Thunk middleware checks the type:

1. If `action` is an object → send it further to the reducer.
    
2. If `action` is a function → execute it and pass `dispatch` and `getState` there.
    

The reducer will never see the function — it exists only in the middleware layer.

#### **What Makes a Thunk Unique**

- Allows running async/await inside an action.
    
- Gives direct control over the sequence of actions.
    
- Keeps the reducer pure and synchronous.

### Important Notes

- A thunk effectively turns Redux into an asynchronous engine without violating the architecture.
    
- Action functions are not actions; they are instructions that create actions.
    
- Redux Toolkit includes Thunk by default (via `configureStore`).
