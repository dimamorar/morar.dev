## What Is Redux Toolkit

> Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official high-level API for Redux, created to reduce boilerplate code, ensure safe immutability, and standardize architecture.  
> It simplifies Store configuration, working with reducers, actions, and asynchronous logic.

---

### Technical Explanation

#### **Main Goal of RTK**

- Simplify the use of Redux.
    
- Reduce the amount of boilerplate (actions, switch, immutable updates).
    
- Embed best practices directly into the tools.
    
- Make Redux architecture safer and more predictable.
    

#### **What RTK Adds**

- **Immer** for safe immutable updates via "draft-state."
    
- **createSlice** for automatic generation of reducers and actions.
    
- **configureStore** with a ready-made configuration of middleware and DevTools.
    
- **createAsyncThunk** with a standard async pattern pending/fulfilled/rejected.
    
- **RTK Query** for managing server data and caching.
    

#### **Why It's Important**

- No longer need to manually write action creators.
    
- Reducers can be written via mutation (but under the hood, a new state is created).
    
- Store settings are uniform and safe by default.
    
- Asynchronous logic becomes standardized.
    

#### **Relationship to Redux**

- RTK is not a replacement for Redux — it is the recommended way to use it.
    
- It makes Redux modern and convenient while maintaining all principles.

### Important Notes

- RTK has been the officially recommended way to use Redux since 2020.
- Most new Redux projects use RTK by default.
- RTK eliminates the risk of incorrect mutations and simplifies developer onboarding.
