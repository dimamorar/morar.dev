## What Is Redux

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, based on a unidirectional data flow and pure reducer functions.  
> It centralizes the state, makes changes deterministic, and provides transparent control over how the UI is updated.

### Technical Explanation

#### **The Main Role of Redux**

- Manage the global state of the application.
    
- Guarantee that updates pass through a controlled process.
    
- Simplify debugging and reproducibility of UI behavior.
    

#### **Key Features**

- Centralized state: one Store holds the entire global state.
    
- Changes are possible only through dispatch(action).
- Reducers handle actions and purely calculate the new state.
- DevTools support: time-travel, action logging, state inspection.

#### **Where Redux is Used**

- In large SPAs where local state or the Context API are insufficient.
- In applications with a lot of business logic and complex interrelationships.

#### **Why Redux Became a Standard**

- Predictability due to immutability and pure functions.
    
- Objectively transparent data flow: easy to understand what happened and why.
    
- Rich ecosystem: middleware, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query.

### Important Notes

- Redux is not exclusively linked to React — it can work with any UI library.
    
- Redux itself is minimalistic; all the power comes through middleware and the Redux Toolkit.
    
- In Redux, there is no Dispatcher (unlike Flux) — dispatch is built into the store.
