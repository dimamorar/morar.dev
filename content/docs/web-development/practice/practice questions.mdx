Questions related to flatten array

> "Flattening" an array means converting nested arrays into a single flat array containing all elements without nesting.

---

### What does it mean to "flatten" an array?

It's the process of converting a multi-dimensional array (`[1, [2, [3]]]`) into a one-dimensional one (`[1, 2, 3]`).

---

### 2. How to implement flatten without built-in methods?

With recursion:

```jsx
function flatten(arr) {
  return arr.reduce(
    (acc, val) => acc.concat(Array.isArray(val) ? flatten(val) : val),
    []
  );
}
```

Here `reduce` combines elements, recursively flattening nested arrays.

---

### 3. How to use the built-in `flat()` method?

```jsx
[1, [2, [3, [4]]]].flat(2); // [1, 2, 3, [4]]
[1, [2, [3, [4]]]].flat(Infinity); // completely flattens
```

The `depth` parameter determines the flattening depth.

---

### 4. Can you flatten without recursion?

Yes, using a stack (iterative way):

```jsx
function flattenIterative(arr) {
  const stack = [...arr];
  const res = [];
  while (stack.length) {
    const next = stack.pop();
    Array.isArray(next) ? stack.push(...next) : res.push(next);
  }
  return res.reverse();
}
```

---

### 5. What are typical mistakes?

- Skipping the `Infinity` parameter in `flat()` if the depth is unknown.
- Using `concat` without considering nested levels.
- Mutating the original array during iteration.
