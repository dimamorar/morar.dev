### 🧩 Main Advantages

- **Static Typing**
    
    Detects compilation errors (type mismatch, missing properties, etc.) even before the code is run.
    
    ```tsx
    let count: number = "5"; // ❌ Type error
    ```
    
- **Improved Autocompletion**
    
    IDE (VS Code) understands types and offers hints for methods, properties, and function parameters.
    
- **Better Refactoring and Code Navigation**
    
    Types provide dependency checking between modules — it's easy to change the structure without errors.
    
- **Compatibility with Modern JS**
    
    TS supports the latest ECMAScript features (async/await, decorators, modules) and compiles them into older standards.
    
- **Clear Documentation via Types**
    
    The code becomes self-documenting: types describe the expected data structure and API.
