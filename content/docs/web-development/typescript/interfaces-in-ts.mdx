> Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure of objects, describing what properties and methods they must have.
> It's a way to establish a **type contract** that ensures consistency and verification during compilation.

### 🧩 Core Idea

- An interface describes the shape of an object — property names, their types, and optionality.
- Does not exist in generated JavaScript — used only at the typing stage.
- Supports **extension (extends)** of other interfaces, allowing for a flexible type hierarchy.

```tsx
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string; // optional property
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Olha",
  age: 28
};
```

### 🧩 Features

- **Type Contract**: any object that implements an interface must have all its properties.
- **Optional fields** (`?`) — not mandatory for implementation.
- **Readonly fields** — forbid modification after initialization.
- **Can describe functions, classes, arrays, objects with indices.**

```tsx
interface Point {
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
}

interface Add {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Interfaces are a **contract** between parts of code.
- Allow for creating type-safe architectures and simplify autocompletion in IDEs.
- Do not exist at runtime but guarantee correctness during compilation.
