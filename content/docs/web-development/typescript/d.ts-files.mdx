> Ambient declarations (.d.ts files) describe types for variables, functions, modules, or libraries that **exist in the execution environment** but **do not have their own definitions in TypeScript code**. They inform the compiler which entities are available without the need for implementation.

---

### 🧩 Main Idea

- TypeScript does not execute code, so it needs to "know" the types of external objects.
- Declaration files allow adding this information — the compiler uses them only for **type checking**, not including them in the `.js` result.

```tsx
// globals.d.ts
declare const VERSION: string;
declare function logMessage(msg: string): void;
```

```tsx
// main.ts
console.log(VERSION); // ✅ compiler knows it's a string
logMessage("Hello!"); // ✅ type checked
```

### 🧩 Declarations for External Libraries

- If a JS library does not have types, you can either:
    1. Install official types from DefinitelyTyped:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/lodash
```
    2. Or create your own `.d.ts` file:
    
```tsx
// custom-lodash.d.ts
declare module "lodash" {
  export function chunk<T>(arr: T[], size?: number): T[][];
}
```

---

### 🧩 The `declare` Keyword

- Used to describe **external entities** — without implementation.

```tsx
declare namespace MyApp {
  const version: string;
  function start(): void;
}
```

- Without `declare`, TypeScript expects a real implementation (code), not just a declaration.

---

### 🧩 Usage in Large Projects

- Used to describe:
    - global variables or environment objects (e.g., `process`, `window`)
    - API of external libraries
    - modules without types
    - type declarations in shared packages

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `.d.ts` files = **"type contract without code"**.
- Do not contain logic, only type signatures.
- Allow TypeScript to "understand" the structure of third-party or global elements.
- Actively used in libraries (`@types/...`) and large codebases for type consistency.
