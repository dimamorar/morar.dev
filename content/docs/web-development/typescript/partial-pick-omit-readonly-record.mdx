### 🧩 `Partial<T>`

- Makes all properties of type `T` **optional** (`?`).

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
/*
  { id?: number; name?: string; }
*/
```

---

### 🧩 `Readonly<T>`

- Makes all properties **read-only** (`readonly`).

```tsx
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
/*
  { readonly id: number; readonly name: string; }
*/
```

---

### 🧩 `Pick<T, K>`

- Creates a new type with **selected keys** `K` from type `T`.

```tsx
type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;
/*
  { id: number; name: string; }
*/
```

---

### 🧩 `Omit<T, K>`

- Creates a type, **excluding certain keys** `K` from `T`.

```tsx
type UserWithoutId = Omit<User, "id">;
/*
  { name: string; }
*/
```

---

### 🧩 `Record<K, T>`

- Creates an object type where **keys have type `K`**, and value has type `T`.

```tsx
type Roles = "admin" | "user" | "guest";
type Permissions = Record<Roles, boolean>;
/*
  {
    admin: boolean;
    user: boolean;
    guest: boolean;
  }
*/
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- All utility types are templates built on the basis of mapped types.
- They increase **flexibility, consistency, and reusability of types**.
- Most often used in large codebases for transformations of objects without structure duplication.
