## How does Git store data — snapshots or differences?

> Git stores not deltas, but full snapshots of file states at the moment of each commit.

### Explanation

Each commit is a **snapshot** of all files, represented as hashes (`blob`).

If a file hasn't changed, Git simply points to the previous blob.

In this way, high storage efficiency and instant rollbacks to any state are achieved.
