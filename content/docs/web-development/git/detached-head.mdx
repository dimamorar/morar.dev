> Detached HEAD is a state when the HEAD pointer refers not to a branch, but to a specific commit.

### Explanation

Occurs when switching to a commit directly:

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

HEAD is "detached" from the branch — new commits will not belong to any branch.

To save changes, create a branch:

```bash
git switch -c new-branch
```
