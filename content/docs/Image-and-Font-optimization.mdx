## **Image and Font Optimization in App Router (next/image, next/font)**

> Next.js automatically optimizes images and fonts to reduce bundle size, speed up rendering, and improve LCP.  
> `next/image` provides responsive, optimized images with lazy loading.  
> `next/font` inlines critical fonts and eliminates layout shifts without additional network requests.

### Technical Explanation

#### `next/image`

- Component for optimized images that:
    
    - automatically selects format (WebP/AVIF);
        
    - creates adaptive sizes (responsive srcset);
        
    - has built-in lazy loading;
        
    - optimizes caching;
        
    - reduces CLS thanks to mandatory sizes (`width`, `height`) or `fill`.
    

**Example:**

```jsx
import Image from "next/image";

<Image src="/hero.jpg" width={1200} height={600} alt="Hero" />
```

#### Core Features

- `priority` for LCP elements;
    
- `placeholder="blur"` for UX;
    
- automatic CDN caching when deploying to Vercel.

### `next/font`

- Replaces Google Fonts API, eliminating network requests.
    
- Fonts are **inlined into the bundle** or delivered optimally (self-hosted).
    
- Eliminates font flickering (FOIT/FOUT).
    

#### Two APIs

1. **`next/font/google`**
    
    - font import directly from Google, but delivered locally.
        
2. **`next/font/local`**
    
    - local fonts from the project.
    

**Example:**

```js
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
```

Then:

```jsx
<body className={inter.className}>...</body>
```

### Next.js Optimization Benefits
- Smaller JS and CSS volume.
- No layout shift from fonts.
- Optimized images improve LCP, FCP.
- Minimal client code — everything via server-side optimization.
