## **How Next.js handles CSS and styling (CSS Modules, global CSS, Tailwind, CSS-in-JS)**

> App Router allows for several styling approaches: global styles, CSS Modules, Tailwind, and CSS-in-JS.  
> Each method has a different scope and affects bundle size and style isolation.  
> All styles are compiled during the build and do not block server-side rendering.

### Technical Explanation

#### Global CSS

- Imported **only in the root layout** `app/layout.js`.
    
- Affects the entire application.
    
- Suitable for resets, variables, and global utility classes.
    

```jsx
import "./globals.css";
```

---

#### CSS Modules

- Isolated CSS files with automatically generated classes.
    
- Files have the format:  
    `component.module.css`
    
- Suitable for component styling without conflicts.
    

```jsx
import styles from "./button.module.css";
```

---

#### Tailwind CSS

- Utility-first approach that integrates well with App Router.
    
- Minimal runtime, all logic in CSS generated during build.
    
- The most popular option for modern Next.js projects.
    

Combinations:

- Tailwind + CSS Modules
    
- Tailwind + local component styles

#### CSS-in-JS (styled-components, Emotion)

- Supported, but with limitations due to RSC:
    
    - styles can **only be applied in Client Components**,
        
    - server components cannot use runtime CSS-in-JS.
        
- Use if dynamic styles based on state are required.
    

---

### App Router Approach to Styles

- Styles are always processed during the build.
    
- No hydration overhead for styles — everything works independently of RSC.
    
- Using Tailwind or CSS Modules minimizes client-side JS.
