## **How rendering modes work in Next.js (RSC, SSR, SSG, ISR) and when to use them**

> Next.js combines several rendering models, where the base is React Server Components, and SSR/SSG/ISR are managed through cache and update policies.  
> App Router uses the server as the main source of UI and decides when to return a cached or dynamic response.  
> The choice of mode depends on data stability, response speed, and personalization requirements.

### Technical Explanation

#### React Server Components (RSC)

- The default mode of App Router — UI is built **on the server without JS hydration**.
    
- Ideal for stable content, heavy logic, and working with databases.
    
- Can be streamed in parts via **React Suspense**.
    

#### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

- Rendering is **performed on every request**, without using the cache.
    
- Used when:
    
    - personalization is needed;
        
    - data changes on every request;
        
    - secure server-only operations are needed.
        
- In App Router, SSR is activated:
    
    - via **dynamic parameters**,
        
    - `fetch({ cache: "no-store" })`,
        
    - `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`.
        

#### SSG (Static Site Generation)

- The page is generated **once during build** and cached as static HTML + RSC payload.
    
- Suitable for stable pages: marketing, documentation, blogs.
    

#### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- Next.js updates static pages **in the background after the `revalidate` time expires**.
    
- The user receives the old version while the new one is being generated.
    
- In App Router, it is implemented via `export const revalidate = N`.
    

#### When to Choose What
- **RSC** — default option, universal.
- **SSR** — personal data, admin panels, dashboards.
- **SSG** — marketing, blog, FAQ.
- **ISR** — semi-dynamic pages: news, product catalogs.
