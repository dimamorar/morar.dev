## Preload vs Prefetch vs Defer vs Async

> These attributes and directives for resource loading management allow optimizing the speed and execution order of scripts and other resources.
> 
> The main difference is **when and why the browser loads and executes the file**.

---

### 🧩 `async`

- The script is **loaded in parallel** with HTML and is **executed immediately after loading**,
    
    **without waiting** for parsing to finish.
    
- Execution order is not guaranteed.
- Used for **external independent scripts** (analytics, advertising).

```html
<script src="analytics.js" async></script>
```

---

### 🧩 `defer`

- The script is **loaded in parallel**, but is executed **after HTML parsing is complete**.
- All `defer` scripts are executed **in the order they were declared**.
- They run **before the `DOMContentLoaded` event**.
- Suitable for **main scripts** interacting with the DOM.

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

---

### 🧩 `preload`

- An instruction for the browser to **start loading in advance** an important resource
    
    that will be needed **in the near future** (fonts, styles, images, scripts).
    
- Does not execute or apply the resource automatically — only loads it.
- Used in `<link>` with `rel="preload"` and the `as` attribute.

```html
<link rel="preload" href="main.js" as="script">
<link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
```

---

### 🧩 `prefetch`

- Allows **loading resources in advance** that **might be needed later**
    (for example, on the next page or during the next action).
- Has a low priority and does not block current rendering.
- Used for **optimizing transitions between pages**.

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="next-page.js" as="script">
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

| Attribute / Directive | When Loaded | When Executed / Used | Main Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`async`** | In parallel with HTML | Immediately after loading | Independent scripts |
| **`defer`** | In parallel with HTML | After parsing, before `DOMContentLoaded` | Main DOM scripts |
| **`preload`** | Immediately (high priority) | When accessing the resource | Preparation of critical resources |
| **`prefetch`** | Later (low priority) | In the future, upon transition | Preloading for the next page |
