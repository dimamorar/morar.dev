### **Session-based Authentication**

### **How it works**

- After a successful login, the server creates a **session** with a unique `session_id`.
- Session data (user, duration, rights) are stored on the server — in memory, Redis, or a DB.
- The client receives a cookie with this `session_id` and automatically sends it in every request.
- The server looks for the entry by ID and restores the user's context.

### **Features**

- **Stateful** — the server stores active sessions.
- Supports **forced logout** (by deleting the entry on the server).
- Requires balancing and synchronization during scaling.
- **CSRF vulnerability**, as the cookie is automatically sent by the browser.

### **Token-based Authentication**

### **How it works**

- After login, the server issues a **token**, usually JWT.
- The token contains user data and is signed with a secret.
- The client stores the token and adds it to the header
    
    `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
    
- The server verifies the signature without accessing the database.

### **Features**

- **Stateless** — the server does not store user sessions.
- Scales easily, suitable for SPA and microservices.
- **Logout is harder** — you can't just "delete" a token, you have to wait for it to expire or use a blacklist.
- Vulnerable to **XSS** if the token is stored in `localStorage`.

### **Comparison**

| Criterion | Session-based | Token-based |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | Stored on server | Stored on client |
| Scaling | Harder (stateful) | Easier (stateless) |
| Logout | Instant | Requires blacklist/TTL |
| Security | Prone to CSRF | Prone to XSS |
| Usage | SSR apps, legacy | SPA, mobile clients, API |

### **Summary**

Session-based is convenient for classic sites with server-side rendering.

Token-based — the standard for modern SPAs and distributed APIs.
