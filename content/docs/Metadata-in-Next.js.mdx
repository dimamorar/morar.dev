## **How Next.js handles metadata (`export const metadata`, dynamic metadata)**

> Metadata API allows defining SEO parameters of pages (title, description, Open Graph, canonical, etc.) directly in server components.  
> Next.js builds metadata on the server during rendering, which ensures correct HTML for search engines.  
> Data can be static or dynamic, depending on whether access to parameters or external data is needed.

### Technical Explanation

#### Static metadata

- Declared in the segment file (layout or page):
    

```js
export const metadata = {
  title: "Dashboard",
  description: "User dashboard",
};
```

- Generated **during build**, if it does not contain dynamics.
    
- Suitable for stable pages.
    

---

#### Dynamic metadata

- Declared via the server function `generateMetadata`.
    
- Used when metadata depends on:
    
    - `params` (slug, id),
        
    - fetch requests,
        
    - business logic conditions.
    

**Example:**

```js
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.summary,
  };
}
```

- Called on the server before rendering the page.
    
- If it performs `fetch` with dynamics (`no-store`), the page becomes SSR.
    

---

#### Where metadata works

- In `layout.js` (globally or per segment).
    
- In `page.js` (specifically for the page).
    
- Can consist of several layers: child metadata complements parent metadata.

#### What can be defined

- `title`, `description`
    
- Open Graph → `openGraph` (title, images)
    
- Twitter cards → `twitter`
    
- `robots`, `canonical`, `icons`
    
- `alternates` (for i18n)
    
- `viewport`, `themeColor`
    

---

### Behavior during rendering

- Metadata is included in `<head>` by the server.
    
- During navigation, React updates the head partially without a full reload.
    
- For dynamic pages, metadata is calculated with each SSR or ISR.
