## What Is a Dispatcher (Flux Context)

> A Dispatcher is the central router of the Flux architecture, responsible for delivering each action to all registered Stores.  
> It ensures sequential processing of actions and guarantees that state updates pass through a single controlled path.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Role of the Dispatcher in Flux**

- Receives actions from the View or other sources.
    
- Passes the action to _every_ Store that is subscribed to events.
    
- Manages the order of action processing, preventing races and unpredictable updates.
    
- Eliminates the chaos of two-way connections characteristic of MVC.
    

#### **Why It's Important in Flux**

- Makes the data flow centralized and deterministic.
    
- Stores cannot communicate with each other directly → only through the Dispatcher.
    
- Eliminates circular dependencies between stores.
    

#### **Dispatcher is Absent in Redux**

Redux simplified the Flux model:

- **There is no Dispatcher in Redux.**
    
- Its role is replaced by:
    
    - a single Store,
        
    - the `dispatch()` mechanism built into the Store,
        
    - the reducer function, which defines state updates.
    

The path in Redux looks like this:

**dispatch(Action) → reducer → new state → UI**

And the routing role is not needed because:

- there is only one Store,
    
- reducers are combined into one composition,
    
- actions are not sent out to multiple Stores.

### Important Notes

- The Dispatcher is a key component of Flux, but **not a part of Redux**.
    
- Questions about the Dispatcher are often used to test understanding of the difference between Flux and Redux.
    
- Redux removed the Dispatcher for architectural simplicity and predictability.
