> A closure is a mechanism that allows a function to "remember" variables from its outer scope even after that outer function has finished executing. The function stores a reference to the environment in which it was created and can access that data later.

### 🧩 What is a Closure

- A closure is formed when an **inner function gains access to variables of an outer function**.
- When such a function is created, the JS engine stores the **lexical environment** — the set of variables available at the time of declaration.
- Thanks to this, the inner function continues to have access to these variables even if the outer function is already completed.

### ⚙️ Why we use closures

1. **Data Encapsulation** — creating private variables and protecting state from external interference.
2. **State Preservation** — preserving values between function calls (e.g., counters, cache).
3. **Function Factories** — generating functions with individual behavior based on enclosed data.
4. **Asynchronous Code** — use in callbacks and event handlers to preserve execution context.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- A closure is the result of **lexical binding of functions and environments**.
- Variables of the outer scope are not copied, but stored **by reference**.
- A primary tool for **modularity, privacy, and state management**.
- Each function call creates its own closure with independent variables.
