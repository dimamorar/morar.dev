> It is not a DOM node or a component — it is a **declarative instruction** from which React forms the Virtual DOM and Fiber tree.

### 🧩 Essence of a React Element

- Represents the interface structure as an **ordinary JavaScript object**.
    
- Created via JSX or `React.createElement()`.
    
- Is **immutable** — any UI update creates a new element.
    
- Describes:
    
    - node type (`div`, `Component`),
        
    - props,
        
    - child elements,
        
    - key (`key`),
        
    - reference (`ref`).

### 🧩 React Element Structure

```js
{   
  $$typeof: Symbol(react.element),   
  type: 'h1',   
  key: null,   
  ref: null,   
  props: {     
    className: 'title',     
    children: 'Hello'   
  },   
  _owner: null 
}
```

Main fields:

- **type** — what element to create: a DOM tag or a component.
- **props** — data, children, attributes.
- **key** — identification of elements in lists.
- **ref** — access to the real DOM or component instance.
- **$$typeof** — a React internal field for type checking.

### 🧩 Why elements are immutable

- Immutability allows React to quickly compare old and new trees.
    
- Any UI change ⇒ a **new React Element** is created.
    
- React determines if an update is needed only by **changing references**, rather than deep comparison.
    
- This makes reconciliation simpler and more performant.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- React Element = declarative description of UI, not the DOM.
    
- Immutability of elements is the basis for fast diffing.
    
- Elements are input data for Virtual DOM and Fiber.
    
- Changing elements triggers the render process and minimal updates to the real DOM.
