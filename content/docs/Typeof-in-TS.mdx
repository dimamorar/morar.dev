> In TypeScript, `typeof` is used not to get the type during runtime, but to extract the type of a variable or object at the compilation stage. This allows reusing the type of an already existing value without duplicating definitions.

### 🧩 Main Idea

- Unlike `typeof` in JavaScript, which returns a string (`"string"`, `"number"`, etc.),
    
    in TypeScript `typeof` returns the **type form** of a variable or object.
    

```tsx
const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Anna",
  active: true,
};

type User = typeof user;
/*
  type User = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    active: boolean;
  }
*/
```

### 🧩 Application in Generic Functions

- `typeof` is often combined with `keyof` to create **type-safe utilities**:

```tsx
const settings = {
  theme: "dark",
  version: 3,
};

type SettingsKeys = keyof typeof settings;
// "theme" | "version"
```

- This allows typing values dynamically based on an already existing object.

---

### 🧩 Usage with Classes

- In classes, `typeof` returns the **constructor type**, not the instance type:

```tsx
class User {
  name = "Olha";
}

type UserType = User;         // instance type
type UserConstructor = typeof User; // constructor type
```

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `typeof` in TypeScript is a **type operator**, not a runtime function.
- Allows creating types based on real variables or objects.
- In combination with `keyof`, it ensures **maximum consistency between data and types**.
