## Why Was Redux Toolkit Created

> Redux Toolkit was created to address the pain points of classic Redux: excessive boilerplate code, complex immutable updates, and the lack of a standardized structure.  
> It makes Redux simpler, shorter, and safer while maintaining its fundamental principles.

---

### Technical Explanation

#### **1. Excessive Boilerplate**

Classic Redux required too much repetitive code:

- manually creating actions,
    
- writing action creators,
    
- using `switch` in reducers,
    
- carefully updating nested objects via spread.
    

RTK automates these steps via `createSlice`.

#### **2. Complexity of Immutable Updates**

- It is difficult to safely update deep structures.
    
- Mutation errors often broke the Redux flow.
    
- Immer inside RTK makes immutability safe and convenient.
    

#### **3. Inconsistency of Project Structure**

Before RTK, each project had its own approaches:

- different folders,
    
- different names,
    
- different tools.
    

RTK standardizes the architecture:

- slices,
    
- configureStore,
    
- unified async logic (createAsyncThunk).
    

#### **4. Lack of Built-in Best Practices**

RTK includes:

- Redux Thunk,
    
- DevTools,
    
- immutability checks,
    
- serializability checks.
    

All of this previously had to be added manually.

#### **5. Lowering the Entry Barrier**

- It is hard for beginners to understand classic Redux.
    
- RTK makes the API intuitive and uniform.
    
- Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.

### Important Notes

- RTK does not change the foundation of Redux — state is read-only, reducers are pure, and the data flow is unidirectional.
    
- It replaces old "handmade Redux" with recommended, modern practice.
    
- RTK has become the official standard for using Redux.
