### 🧩 Main Idea

- Marked with the `abstract` keyword.
- Can contain:
    - **implemented methods** (common logic);
    - **abstract methods** (without implementation) — they must be overridden in subclasses.

```tsx
abstract class Shape {
  abstract getArea(): number; // ❌ no implementation

  printArea() {
    console.log("Area:", this.getArea());
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(private radius: number) {
    super();
  }

  getArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
circle.printArea(); // ✅ "Area: 314.15"

```

### 🧩 Features

- Instances of an abstract class cannot be created:
    
    ```tsx
    const s = new Shape(); // ❌ Error
    ```
    
- Can implement interfaces.
- Allows combining **common implementation** and a **contract** that is subject to overriding.
- Useful for **class hierarchies** (e.g., `Animal → Dog`, `Bird`).

### 💡 Key Ideas

- An abstract class is a **template for descendants**, not a finished object.
- Defines the common structure and behavior that must be implemented in child classes.
- Used when there is **common logic**, but part of the behavior depends on the specific implementation.
