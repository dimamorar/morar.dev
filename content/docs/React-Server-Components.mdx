## **React Server Components and why they are at the core of App Router**

> React Server Components execute on the server and allow building UI without passing unnecessary JavaScript to the browser.  
> They enable rendering data, executing server logic, and forming the component tree before sending it to the client.  
> In App Router, RSC is the default mode that defines the architecture of rendering, caching, and navigation.

### Technical Explanation

#### The Main Idea of RSC

- Components execute **in the server environment**, not the browser.
    
- The result of their work is a **serialized tree** that React can combine with client components.
    
- No access to DOM, state, effect hooks, and browser APIs.
    

#### Why they are the core of App Router

- Allow moving heavy logic (requests, data processing, list rendering) to the server.
    
- Provide a **minimal client bundle** and reduce hydration.
    
- Building UI via RSC makes rendering **streaming** and **partial** (partial rendering) via Suspense.
    
- Enables server interactions without API endpoints (e.g., **Server Actions**).
    

#### What tasks RSC solve

- Working with databases and secrets without exposure to the client.
    
- Flexible caching at the fetch level and at the route level.
    
- Creating fast UIs where the client receives ready HTML + RSC payload.
    

#### When Client Components are needed

- Interactivity (events, state, useEffect).
    
- Working with DOM API.
    
- Animations, drag-n-drop, client-only logic.
