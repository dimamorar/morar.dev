## What Is Middleware in Redux

> Middleware is a layer between `dispatch(action)` and the reducer, allowing you to intercept actions and extend Redux behavior without changing its core.  
> It adds the ability to perform side effects, asynchronous operations, logging, as well as to modify or cancel actions.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Role of Middleware**

- Intercepts every action before it reaches the reducer.
    
- Can:
    
    - pass the action further,
        
    - change it,
        
    - cancel it,
        
    - send new actions,
        
    - perform a side effect (e.g., an API request).
    

#### **Middleware in the Redux Chain**

The action processing cycle looks like this:

**Action → dispatch → Middleware Chain → Reducer → New State**

- `dispatch()` starts the middleware chain.
    
- Each middleware decides what to do next.
    
- At the end of the chain, the action reaches the reducer.
    

#### **What Middleware is Used For**

- Asynchronous logic (e.g., Thunk, Saga).
- Logging of actions and states.
- Tracing and analytics.
- Validation and filtering of actions.
- Error handling.
- Working with tokens, authorization, refresh flows.
    

#### **Why Middleware is Important**

- Redux itself is synchronous.
    
- Middleware makes it flexible, extensible, and suitable for complex scenarios.

### Important Notes

- Middleware never changes the state — only the reducer does.
    
- The order of connecting middleware affects the behavior of the chain.
    
- Redux Toolkit automatically includes useful middleware (thunk, immutability checks, serializability checks).
