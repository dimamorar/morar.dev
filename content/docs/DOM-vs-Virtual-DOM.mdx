### 🧩 DOM (Document Object Model)

- DOM is a **real tree of objects**, reflecting the structure of an HTML document in the browser.
- Every element on the page is a **node (`node`)**, available for reading, changing, and deleting through JavaScript.
- Main disadvantage: **any change** to the DOM causes **repaint** and **reflow (style recalculation)**.
- With a large number of operations, this makes interface updates **slow and costly** in terms of performance.

---

### 🧩 Virtual DOM (Virtual DOM)

- Virtual DOM is a **virtual copy of the real DOM** that exists **in memory**.
- Used by libraries like **React** to optimize rendering.

When the application state changes:

1. A **new virtual tree** is created.
2. The **diffing** process is performed — comparing the new and old Virtual DOM.
3. The **minimal set of changes** is determined.
4. In the **reconciliation** stage, these changes are **point-applied to the real DOM**.

---

### 💡 Main Idea

- **DOM** — works directly with the browser, every change causes a re-render.
- **Virtual DOM** — works in memory and updates **only changed nodes**, minimizing the load.
- This approach makes updates **faster, more efficient, and less costly**.
