## **Difference between SSR, SSG, and CSR in a general web context**

> SSR, SSG, and CSR are three rendering models that determine where and when a page's HTML is formed.  
> They affect performance, SEO, and user interaction.  
> The choice of mode depends on data dynamism and personalization requirements.

### Technical Explanation

#### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

- HTML is generated **on the server during each request**.
    
- Suitable for:
    
    - personalized pages;
        
    - frequently changing data;
        
    - complex business rules with access to server resources.
        
- Slower TTFB, but good SEO.
    

Example behavior:

- User → server renders the page → sends HTML → client hydrates JS.

#### SSG (Static Site Generation)

- HTML is generated **once during build**.
    
- Ideal for:
    
    - marketing landing pages, documentation;
        
    - blogs, pages with infrequent updates.
        
- Very fast TTFB, as a static file is served.
    

Disadvantage:

- Data is "frozen" at the time of build; ISR or a rebuild is needed to update it.

#### CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

- The server returns minimal HTML + JS, and rendering is performed **entirely in the browser**.
- Suitable for SPAs with active interaction and private dashboards.
- SEO is limited if search engines do not execute JS.
- UI does not appear until JS is loaded and executed.

### Essential Comparison
- **SSR** → render on the server every time.
- **SSG** → render once during build.
- **CSR** → render in the browser based on JS.
