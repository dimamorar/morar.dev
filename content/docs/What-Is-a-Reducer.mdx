## What Is a Reducer

> A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns a new state.  
> It defines **how** the state should change in response to an action, while not performing side effects and not mutating the incoming data.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Reducer's Role**

- Core of the Redux business logic.
    
- Defines the reaction to each action.
    
- Guarantees determinism: same input → same output.
    

#### **Requirements for a Reducer**

1. **Must be a pure function**
    
    - No side effects (network requests, timers).
        
    - No mutation of arguments.
        
    - Does not depend on external mutable state.
        
2. **Must return a new object**
    
    - Immutability is a critical condition for correct UI updates.
        
    - In the Redux Toolkit, "mutation" inside a reducer is actually safe thanks to Immer.
        
3. **Must have a predictable result**
    
    - If the action is not recognized, the original state is returned.
        
    - A reducer cannot return `undefined`.
    

#### **Reducer Structure**

Minimal form:

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

#### **Reducer Composition**

- Redux allows splitting logic into many reducers.
    
- `combineReducers` collects them into a single root reducer.
    
- Each slice reducer is responsible for its own fragment of state.

### Important Notes

- The reducer is the only place where the logic for changing state is defined.
- Any mutation inside a reducer breaks the Redux flow and optimizations.
- In RTK, the reducer is described inside `createSlice`, but the concept remains the same.
