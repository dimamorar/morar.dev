## **Server Actions and how they change form handling and mutations in Next.js**

> Server Actions allow calling server functions directly from components without creating API routes.  
> They execute exclusively on the server, transfer data through a special React protocol, and do not add JS to the client bundle.  
> This makes mutations simpler, safer, and closer to regular server functions.

### Technical Explanation

#### The Main Idea

- A Server Action is a function declared in an RSC or Client Component with the directive:
    

```js
"use server";
```

- Called through a form or through function import.
    
- Executed on the server **in a completely isolated context** (not available in global JS).

#### Form Handling

- An HTML form can directly call a server action:
    

```jsx
<form action={updateUser}>
  <input name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

- Data is automatically serialized and passed to the Server Action.
    
- No need for:
    
    - API Endpoint
        
    - useState for forms
        
    - fetch in Client Component

#### Calling via JavaScript
- A Server Action can be imported and called programmatically:

```js
import { updateUser } from "./actions";

await updateUser({ name: "John" });
```

---
#### Advantages
- Less client JS → faster rendering.
- Simpler interaction: no need to create a separate API route.
- Access to database and secrets directly in the Server Action.
- Typed environment (integrates well with TypeScript).

---
#### Limitations
- Browser APIs cannot be used in a Server Action.
- Client components are needed only if there is interaction (buttons, inputs with JS).
- It's important to configure the cache correctly, as mutations can punch through static layers.
