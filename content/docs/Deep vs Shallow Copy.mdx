> Shallow copy creates a new object but only copies the top level — nested objects are passed by reference.  

#### Core Concept
- Copies only “surface” properties.
- Nested objects, arrays, and other reference types remain shared.

#### Examples of shallow copy
- `Object.assign({}, obj)`
- Spread: `{ ...obj }`, `[ ...arr ]`
- `Array.prototype.slice()`

#### Drawback
- Changing nested elements in the copy affects the original (and vice versa).

### Deep Copy
> Deep copy creates a completely independent structure, recursively copying all nested levels of data.

#### Core Concept
- A completely new structure is created without shared reference values.
- Each nested level is copied recursively.

#### Ways to deep copy
- `structuredClone(value)` — the modern native way.
- `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` — has limitations (Date, undefined, functions).
- Manual recursion or special libraries (lodash `cloneDeep`).

#### Advantage
- The copy is completely isolated → safe modification of nested data.

### Minimal Example

```js
const original = { user: { name: 'Ann' } };

// shallow copy
const shallow = { ...original };
shallow.user.name = 'Tom'; // changes original.user.name

// deep copy
const deep = structuredClone(original);
deep.user.name = 'Sam'; // original remains unchanged
```

### Important Notes
- In Redux, shallow copy is recommended for updating state, but the structure should be built so that nested objects do not require deep copying.
- JSON deep copy is unsuitable for complex structures (Map, Set, Date, functions).
