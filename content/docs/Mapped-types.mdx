> Mapped types allow creating new types based on existing ones, iterating through all the keys of a type or interface. They are often used for building **utility types** (`Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Record`).

---

### 🧩 Core Idea

- Mapped type syntax is based on **iteration over keys** of a type using `keyof`.

```tsx
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type OptionalUser = {
  [K in keyof User]?: User[K];
};
/*
  type OptionalUser = {
    id?: number;
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
  }
*/
```

- `[K in keyof User]` goes through each key of the `User` type
    
    and creates a new type with the necessary modifications.
    

---

### 🧩 Modification of Properties

Mapped types allow changing properties:

- making them **optional** `?`
- making them **read-only** `readonly`
- changing the value type

```tsx
type ReadonlyUser = {
  readonly [K in keyof User]: User[K];
};

type StringifyUser = {
  [K in keyof User]: string;
};
```

---

### 🧩 Combination with generic types

- Mapped types often generalize a template and work for any type:

```tsx
type PartialType<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]?: T[K];
};

type PartialUser = PartialType<User>;
```

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Mapped types = **mass transformation of types**.
- Allows creating new types without code duplication.
- Actively used in built-in TypeScript utilities (`Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Record`, `Omit`).
- Increases the **flexibility and scalability** of the type system.
