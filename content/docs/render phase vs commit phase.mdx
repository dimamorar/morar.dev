> React Fiber performs updates in two separate phases: **Render Phase** and **Commit Phase**.  
> The render phase can be interrupted, deferred, or repeated, while the commit phase is always executed synchronously and is guaranteed.

### 🧩 Render Phase (reconciliation)

**Goal:** calculate *what* needs to be updated in the UI.
The Render Phase is also called the **reconciliation phase** because in it React:

- creates or updates Fiber nodes,
- compares `pendingProps` with `memoizedProps`,
- determines which Fibers are changed, added, or deleted,
- forms the **effect list** (a list of changes for the DOM).

#### 🔹 Properties of Render Phase

- **Can be interrupted** → React will give control back to the browser.
- **Can be resumed** → will continue from the moment of pause.
- **Can be cancelled** → if new priority updates arrive.
- **Can be performed repeatedly** → if props/state have changed.

> In the render phase, React **does not touch the DOM**.

It's pure computational work.

### 🧩 Commit Phase

**Goal:** apply all calculated changes to the real DOM.

In the commit phase, React:
1. Performs DOM mutations (insertions/deletions/updates).
2. Calls layout effects (`useLayoutEffect`).
3. Activates passive effects (`useEffect`) in a deferred cycle.

#### 🔹 Properties of Commit Phase
- **Always synchronous**.
- **Cannot be interrupted**.
- **Executed quickly**, because only the physical application of calculated changes is done.
- Uses the **effect list** formed in the render phase.

> Commit Phase is the only place where React interacts with the DOM.

### 🧩 Why two phases?

- Separation allows avoiding browser blocking.
- Unnecessary or outdated results of the render phase can be cancelled.
- The commit phase is fast, so it executes without the risk of freezes.
- This is exactly how **concurrent rendering** is implemented.

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Render Phase = "what to change". Commit Phase = "apply changes".
- Render phase can be interrupted, resumed, or cancelled.
- Commit phase is always synchronous and works with the DOM.
- This separation is the basis of Fiber, concurrent rendering, and Suspense.
