## **Where to Store JWT: Cookies vs LocalStorage**

> The storage location of a token directly impacts the security of the application.

> The primary choice is between **HttpOnly cookies**, which are protected from JavaScript, and **LocalStorage**, which is accessible from client-side code.

---

### **1. Cookies**

### **Features**

- The token is stored in a cookie and is automatically sent by the browser with every request.
- If the cookie is marked with the **HttpOnly** flag, it is inaccessible from JavaScript.
- It can have flags:
    - `Secure` — transfer only over HTTPS
    - `SameSite` — restriction of cross-site requests
    - `Expires / Max-Age` — expiration period

### **Advantages**

- Protection against **XSS** (since the token is inaccessible from JS).
- Simple integration with SSR and browser requests.
- Suitable for **refresh tokens** or **session cookies**.

### **Disadvantages**

- Susceptible to **CSRF attacks** if `SameSite` is not configured.
- Not suitable for mobile clients without cookie storage.

---

### **2. LocalStorage**

### **Features**

- Manual storage of the token in the browser (`localStorage.setItem('token', ...)`).
- The token is retrieved and added to the `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header with every request.

### **Advantages**

- Simplicity of implementation for **SPA** and REST APIs.
- Full control over when and how the token is sent.
- Not automatically sent by the browser → **no CSRF**.

### **Disadvantages**

- Susceptible to **XSS** — any malicious script can read the token.
- No automatic expiration period.
- Requires additional security measures (CSP, sanitization, logout flow).

---

### **3. Alternative — Memory Storage**

- Storing the token only in memory (RAM) during the session.
- Reset when the page is refreshed → increased security.
- A compromise between convenience and protection (often used with silent refresh).

---

### **Security Recommendations**

| Token Type | Where to Store | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Token** | In memory or LocalStorage | Fast access from JS is needed |
| **Refresh Token** | In HttpOnly cookie | Maximum protection against XSS |

---

### **Summary**

- **Cookies (HttpOnly)** — more secure but require CSRF protection.
- **LocalStorage** — simpler but vulnerable to XSS.
- In practice: **Access Token in memory**, **Refresh Token in HttpOnly cookie** — a balance between UX and security.
