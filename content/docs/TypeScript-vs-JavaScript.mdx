### 🧩 Essence of TypeScript

- Developed by Microsoft as a **typed superset of JavaScript**.
- Any valid JS is valid TS.
- Adds **types**, **interfaces**, **classes**, **generics**, and other features.
- Compiles into regular JavaScript for execution in the browser or Node.js.

```tsx
let username: string = "Alex";
let age: number = 25;
```

### 🧩 Differences from JavaScript

- **Static typing**: errors are detected before the code is run.
- **Support for OOP concepts** (classes, interfaces, access modifiers).
- **IDE type checks** (autocompletion, IntelliSense).
- **Compilation is mandatory** (`tsc` → `.js`).

### 💡 Key Ideas

- TypeScript = JavaScript + types + safety.
- Facilitates refactoring and team development.
- Increases the stability of large projects but requires compiler configuration.
