## React Lifecycle: from mounting to unmounting

> The lifecycle of a React component is a sequence of stages that a component goes through from creation to removal from the DOM.

> The goal is to provide points (hooks or methods) where you can manage side effects, state, and initialization logic.

### 🧩 Main Lifecycle Stages

1. **Mounting** — the component is created and added to the DOM.
2. **Updating** — occurs when props or state change.
3. **Unmounting** — the component is removed from the DOM.

### 🧩 Lifecycle in Class Components

**1. Mounting:**

- `constructor()` — initializing state and binding methods.
- `render()` — creating Virtual DOM elements.
- `componentDidMount()` — called after insertion into the DOM (often used for data requests).

**2. Updating:**

- `shouldComponentUpdate()` — control over the necessity of a re-render.
- `render()` — updating the Virtual DOM.
- `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)` — called after the DOM update.

**3. Unmounting:**

- `componentWillUnmount()` — cleanup of timers, listeners, cancelling subscriptions.

### 🧩 Lifecycle in Functional Components (Hooks API)

**Mounting + Updating:**

- `useEffect(() => {...})` — called after rendering.
- `useLayoutEffect(() => {...})` — called synchronously before the paint.

**Unmounting:**

- Returning a cleanup function in `useEffect`:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(log, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id); // cleanup
}, []);

    ```

**Render Control:**
- `React.memo` or dependency optimization in `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- The lifecycle reflects the internal process of **creation → updating → deletion** of a component.
- In modern projects, all lifecycle logic is implemented through **Hooks**.
- Effects (`useEffect`) combine the behavior of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
- Proper use of hooks ensures **cleanliness of side effects and manageability of state**.
