### 🧩 Essence

- Used when the developer **knows the type of value better** than TypeScript.
- Allows **overriding or refining the type** determined by the compiler.
- Does not perform any runtime checks — only affects the type system.

```tsx
let value: unknown = "Hello TS";
let strLength = (value as string).length; // ✅ compiler knows this is a string
```

---

### 🧩 Alternative Syntax

TypeScript supports two forms of notation:

```tsx
const input = document.querySelector("input") as HTMLInputElement;
```

or (old syntax, not recommended in JSX files):

```tsx
const input = <HTMLInputElement>document.querySelector("input");
```

---

### 🧩 Limitations

- Type assertion **does not perform a check** — you can specify any type, even an incorrect one.
- Misuse can lead to runtime errors.
- It is safer to use **user-defined type guards** or type checks if in doubt.

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Type assertion ≠ type casting (does not actually convert the type).
- Applied when TypeScript cannot infer the exact type itself.
- Use with caution, only when you are sure of the data type.
