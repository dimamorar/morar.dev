## **Features of `fetch` in Next.js and the caching/revalidation mechanism**

> In App Router, `fetch` is executed on the server and has built-in integration with cache and regeneration policies.  
> The result of `fetch` can be static, dynamic, or re-validated in the background through ISR.  
> The `fetch` configuration directly determines the page's rendering mode.

### Technical Explanation

#### Server-side `fetch`

- In RSC, `fetch` **is always executed on the server**, even if the call is made from a Client Component through imported server code.
    
- In RSC, `fetch` by default **caches** the result (`cache: "force-cache"`).
    
- In Client Components, `fetch` works like a regular browser one.

#### Caching Policies

##### 1. **Static Cache**

```js
fetch(url); // cache: "force-cache" (default)
```

- Triggers SSG or ISR depending on the presence of `revalidate`.
    

##### 2. **Dynamic (no-store)**

```js
fetch(url, { cache: "no-store" });
```

- Forces **SSR on every request**.
    
- Disables cache at all levels.
    

##### 3. **Revalidate (ISR)**

```js
fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 60 } });
```

- The page will update in the background after 60 seconds.
    
- Suitable for semi-dynamic data.

#### fetch Interaction → rendering mode

| fetch Configuration | Mode |
| --- | --- |
| `cache: "force-cache"` | SSG / ISR |
| `next: { revalidate }` | ISR |
| `cache: "no-store"` | SSR |
| dependency on cookies/headers | SSR |

#### Important Feature

Any **dynamic factor** turns the page into SSR:

- reading cookies;
    
- reading headers;
    
- `cache: "no-store"`;
    
- `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`;
    
- dynamic parameters.
