### 🧩 Debouncing

- **Debounce** delays function execution until a specified time has passed **after the last call**.
- If the event occurs again before the timer expires, the wait is reset.
- Suitable when you need to wait for the **end of a series of events** (e.g., the user has finished typing).

```jsx
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

window.addEventListener('resize', debounce(() => {
  console.log('Resize finished');
}, 300));

```

📘 Called **once after a pause** in activity.

---

### 🧩 Throttling

- **Throttle** limits the frequency of function execution: it is called **no more often** than once in a specified interval.
- Even if the event triggers more often, the function runs **at a fixed interval**.
- Suitable for **smooth, even updates**, for example during `scroll` or `mousemove`.

```jsx
function throttle(fn, interval) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= interval) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}

window.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scroll event (throttled)');
}, 200));

```

📘 Called **regularly**, but no more often than the set interval.

### ⚖️ Comparison

| Criterion | **Debounce** | **Throttle** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **When called** | After the last event | At regular intervals |
| **Behavior during frequent calls** | Resets timer | Ignores extra calls |
| **Suitable for** | `resize`, `search input`, `autocomplete` | `scroll`, `mousemove`, `resize` |
| **Goal** | Execute once after a pause | Execute periodically with frequency limitation |

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **Debouncing** eliminates "noise" from frequent events by performing an action only after activity has ceased.
- **Throttling** controls execution frequency, maintaining interface responsiveness.
- Both techniques are based on **timers** (`setTimeout`, `Date.now()`) and are often used in **frontend performance optimization**.
- Libraries like Lodash provide ready-made implementations: `_.debounce()` and `_.throttle()`.
