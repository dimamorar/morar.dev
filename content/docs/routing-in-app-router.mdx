## **How routing works in App Router (route segments, nested layouts, dynamic routes)**
> App Router uses a segmented file structure where each directory corresponds to a part of the URL.  
> Routes are formed through nested segments and layouts that allow building a hierarchical UI.  
> Dynamic parameters, parallel segments, and interceptors provide flexible page composition.

### Technical Explanation

#### Route Segments

- Each folder in `app/` is a **route segment**.
    
    - `app/dashboard` → `/dashboard`
        
    - `app/blog/[slug]` → `/blog/:slug`
        
- Each segment can have:
    
    - **page.js** — the final page;
        
    - **layout.js** — a shell that is preserved between navigations;
        
    - **loading.js**, **error.js**, **not-found.js** — special states.
        

#### Nested Layouts

- Layouts form a navigation tree:
    
    - global `app/layout.js`;
        
    - segment-level `app/dashboard/layout.js`;
        
    - child `app/dashboard/settings/layout.js`.
        
- Layouts **preserve state**, without re-mounting upon transitions within the segment.
    
- They support **shared UI**: sidebars, headers, breadcrumbs.
    

#### Dynamic Routes

- Created through **square brackets**:
    
    - `[id]` → `/products/123`
        
    - `[slug]` → `/blog/react-server-components`
        
- The value is passed via `params`.
    

#### Catch-All Routes

- `[...slug]` → allows any path depth.
    
    - `/docs/a/b/c`
        
- Optional catch-all: `[[...slug]]` — also matches the root `/docs`.
    

#### Special Routing Features in App Router

- **Parallel segments** (`@modal`, `@feed`) — render several UI branches in parallel.
    
- **Intercepting routes** (`(.)`, `(..)`, `(...)`) — allow opening pages in modals.
    
- **Route Handlers** (`route.js`) — API endpoints within a segment.
