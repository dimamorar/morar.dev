## 1. Definition and Role of HTTP

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is a protocol that enables data exchange between a client (browser) and a server. Every time you open a webpage or send a request to an API, HTTP is used.

### Essential Parts of HTTP:

- **Request**: contains the method, URL, headers, and optionally a body.
- **Response**: contains the status code, headers, and the body with the data.

## 2. HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define what action the client wants to perform on the server.

**Common Methods:**

- `GET` — retrieve data. Used to load pages or fetch API data.
- `POST` — create or send data to the server. Used when submitting forms or creating resources.
- `PUT` — fully replace an existing resource.
- `PATCH` — partially update a resource.
- `DELETE` — remove a resource.
- `OPTIONS` — check which methods and headers the server supports (often used in CORS preflight).

## 3. HTTP Status Codes

Status codes inform the client about the result of the request.

- **1xx** — informational (e.g., `100 Continue`)
- **2xx** — success (`200 OK`, `201 Created`)
- **3xx** — redirection (`301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`)
- **4xx** — client errors (`400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`)
- **5xx** — server errors (`500 Internal Server Error`)

## 4. HTTP Headers

Headers are metadata sent along with a request or response.

**Request Headers:**

- `Content-Type` — type of data sent by the client.
- `Accept` — type of data the client can handle.
- `Authorization` — tokens or credentials.
- `Cache-Control` — caching rules.

**Response Headers:**

- `Content-Type` — type of data returned.
- `Set-Cookie` — stores session information.
- `Cache-Control` — caching rules for the client.

---

## 5. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**What is CORS:** a browser security mechanism that controls access to resources from different origins.

**Why frontend developers face issues:**

- Browsers block requests to another domain unless the server explicitly allows it via the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
- Before the main request, the browser may send a **preflight request** with the `OPTIONS` method.

**Tips:**

- Configure the server or proxy to allow CORS for trusted domains.
- Use proper caching headers (`Cache-Control`) to improve performance.
