## How `createAsyncThunk` Works
> `createAsyncThunk` is the standard Redux Toolkit mechanism for describing asynchronous operations.  
> It automatically generates three request states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and allows managing async logic without manually creating dozens of actions.

---

### Technical Explanation

#### **Core Idea**

`createAsyncThunk` accepts:

- **typePrefix** — the name of the operation
    
- **payloadCreator** — an asynchronous function that performs the request
    

After calling, the thunk returns a **promise**, and Redux automatically dispatches three events:

- `${typePrefix}/pending`
    
- `${typePrefix}/fulfilled`
    
- `${typePrefix}/rejected`
    

#### **How the async flow is executed**

1. Component calls:  
    `dispatch(fetchUser())`
    
2. RTK generates and dispatches `fetchUser/pending`.
    
3. `payloadCreator` is executed (e.g., `await fetch(...)`).
    
4. If successful → `fetchUser/fulfilled` is dispatched with the data.
    
5. If error → `fetchUser/rejected` is dispatched with the error.
    

All these actions are automatically intercepted by reducers in `extraReducers`.

#### **Advantages**

- No need to manually create three actions (loading/success/error).
    
- Built-in typing and error control.
    
- Clear async logic standard across the project.
    
- Works on top of Redux Thunk but abstracts low-level code.
    

#### **How it works with reducers**

In `createSlice`, you can handle states:

```js
builder
  .addCase(fetchUser.pending, …)
  .addCase(fetchUser.fulfilled, …)
  .addCase(fetchUser.rejected, …)
```

This gives full control over UI states: loading/error/data.

### Important Notes

- `createAsyncThunk` always returns a promise — this allows waiting for operations in components or other thunks.
    
- Errors automatically go into `rejected` without the need for manual try/catch in the slice.
    
- This is the recommended async logic standard in Redux Toolkit.
