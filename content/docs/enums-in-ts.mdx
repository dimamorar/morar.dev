> Used for convenient handling of fixed sets of values — for example, statuses, roles, or directions.

### 🧩 Numeric Enums

- By default, enum values are **numeric**, starting from `0`.
- Each subsequent element automatically gets an incremented value.

```tsx
enum Direction {
  Up,       // 0
  Down,     // 1
  Left,     // 2
  Right,    // 3
}

const move = Direction.Left; // 2
```

- Initial values can be explicitly set:

```tsx
enum Status {
  Pending = 1,
  Success = 2,
  Failed = 3,
}
```

---

### 🧩 String Enums

- Each member of an `enum` can be a string — this increases readability and safety.

```tsx
enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST",
}

const access = Role.Admin; // "ADMIN"
```

---

### 🧩 Heterogeneous Enums

- TypeScript allows combining string and numeric values, but this is **not recommended** due to unclear behavior.

```tsx
enum Mix {
  No = 0,
  Yes = "YES",
}
```

---

### 🧩 Reverse Mapping

- For numeric `enums`, TypeScript creates a **reverse mapping** — you can get the name by value.

```tsx
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

console.log(Color[0]); // "Red"
```

- There is no reverse mapping for string `enums`.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `enum` is a way to group related constants under one name.
- There are **numeric**, **string**, and **heterogeneous** variations.
- They increase code readability and simplify working with predefined sets of values.
- When compiled, they turn into a JavaScript object with keys and values.
