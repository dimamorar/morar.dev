> Security best practices for authentication and authorization systems.

### **General Security Principles**

- Always use **HTTPS** for all authentication-related communications.
- Implement proper **token expiration** and **refresh mechanisms**.
- Store sensitive tokens (refresh tokens) in **HttpOnly cookies**.
- Implement **token rotation** for refresh tokens.
- Use **short-lived access tokens** (15 minutes or less).
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks.
- Use **secure password hashing** (bcrypt, Argon2).
- Implement **CSRF protection** for cookie-based authentication.
- Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks.

### **Token Security**

- Access tokens: store in memory or secure storage, short expiration.
- Refresh tokens: store in HttpOnly cookies, longer expiration, revocable.
- Implement token blacklist/revocation mechanism.
- Never store tokens in localStorage for sensitive applications.

### **Authentication Security**

- Require strong passwords with complexity rules.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for sensitive accounts.
- Use secure session management.
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts.
- Log all authentication events for security monitoring.

### **Authorization Security**

- Verify permissions on every request (never trust client-side checks).
- Use principle of least privilege.
- Implement role-based or attribute-based access control.
- Invalidate tokens when user permissions change.
- Store authorization rules on the server, not client.
