- **Short lifespan** — from a few minutes to an hour.
- Contains data (claims): `userId`, `role`, `exp`.
- After the expiration date — becomes invalid.
- Loss of token = loss of access (it cannot be revoked without a blacklist mechanism).

### **Security**

- Transfer only via HTTPS.
- Store in secure location (memory or HttpOnly cookie).
- Keep expiration time short.
