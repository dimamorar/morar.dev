title: "Bearer Tokens"

> A Bearer token is an access token that confirms its owner has the right to make a request on behalf of the user.
> Used in the **OAuth 2.0** standard and passed through the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

OAuth 2.0 is **a framework for delegated authentication and authorization**, where a user trusts a third-party service (identity provider) to confirm their identity and issue an access token. The token is the only thing the client uses to access protected APIs.

### **Working Principle**

1. **The client requests authorization** — the user logs in through a provider (e.g., Google).
2. **The Identity Provider** verifies the data and issues an **Authorization Code**.
3. The client exchanges this code for an **Access Token** (and optionally a Refresh Token).
4. The client stores the Access Token and adds it to the header of every request:

   `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

5. The resource server validates the token and provides access.

### **What is "Bearer"**

The word _Bearer_ means: **whoever presents the token is considered the owner of the access rights**.

→ If the token is stolen, the attacker receives the same rights.

Therefore, it is critically important to:

- Transfer tokens only via HTTPS,
- Store them in a secure place,
- Set a short lifespan.

### **Token Types in OAuth 2.0**

- **Access Token** — a short-lived token used to access the API.
- **Refresh Token** — a long-lived token that allows updating the Access Token without re-logging.
- **ID Token** — a token containing user information (in OpenID Connect).

### **Security Features**

- A Bearer token is not encrypted, but **signed** (e.g., as a JWT).
- Verified by the server by signature or by request to the Authorization Server.
- Loss of token = loss of access → it must be possible to **revoke** it.

### **Application**

- The main standard for **REST API**, **SPA**, and **mobile clients**.
- Used in conjunction with OpenID Connect to pass user information.
