> Two types of tokens used in authentication and authorization systems.
> **Access Token** provides temporary access to resources, while **Refresh Token** is used to safely update expired access tokens without the user having to log in again.

### **Access Token**

The main token confirming that the user is authorized. Sent in every request to the API in the header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. Used to access protected resources.

**Characteristics:**

- **Short lifespan** — from a few minutes to an hour.
- Contains data (claims): `userId`, `role`, `exp`.
- After the expiration date — becomes invalid.
- Loss of token = loss of access (it cannot be revoked without a blacklist mechanism).

### **Refresh Token**

Allows obtaining a new Access Token without repeated authentication. Used in the background (silent refresh) or during explicit session updates.

**Characteristics:**

- **Long-lived** (days, weeks, months).
- Not used directly to access the API.
- Stored in a more secure place (e.g., `HttpOnly cookie`).
- Can be revoked on the server upon logout or compromise.

### **Interaction Mechanism**

1. The user logs in → the server issues **access** and **refresh** tokens.
2. The client uses the access token for API requests.
3. When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the server.
4. The server verifies the refresh token and issues a new access token (and, if necessary, a new refresh token).
5. The user continues working without logging in again.

### **Key Differences**

| Criterion       | Access Token               | Refresh Token          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Purpose         | API Access                 | Updating access token  |
| Lifespan        | Short (minutes/hours)      | Long (days/weeks)      |
| Where used      | In every request           | Only during update     |
| Where stored    | Usually in memory / cookie | Only in secure storage |
| Compromise risk | Loss = access leak         | Loss = update leak     |

### **Security**

- Transfer only via HTTPS.
- Store refresh token in **HttpOnly cookie**.
- Implement **token rotation** (updating the refresh token with every use).
- Invalidate the refresh token upon logout.
