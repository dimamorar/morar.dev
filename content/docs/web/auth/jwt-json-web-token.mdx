> A compact, secure token format used for transmitting authentication data between client and server.
> JWT is signed with a secret or private key, allowing verification of authenticity and data integrity without database access.

### **Structure**

JWT consists of **three parts**, separated by dots:

`header.payload.signature`

1. **Header** — metadata: token type and signature algorithm.

   ```json
   { "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }
   ```

2. **Payload** — data payload (claims):
   - standard fields:
     `iss` (issuer), `sub` (subject), `iat` (issued at), `exp` (expiration)
   - custom:
     `{ "userId": 42, "role": "admin" }`
3. **Signature** — result of `HMACSHA256(base64url(header) + "." + base64url(payload), secret)`

   The signature ensures protection against tampering.

### **Encoding**

- Header and Payload are encoded in **Base64URL** (a URL-safe variant of Base64).
- Signature — a cryptographic signature confirming token integrity.
- A full JWT looks like a single string:
  ```
  eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjQyLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.FpXx8...

  ```

### **How Validation Works**

1. Client sends the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header.
2. Server decodes Header + Payload, calculates the signature, and compares it with the transmitted one.
3. If the signature matches and the expiration time (`exp`) hasn't passed — the token is valid.
4. Server gets user data from the Payload without a repeated database request.

### **Advantages**

- **Stateless** — does not require session storage.
- Compact (transmitted in the HTTP header).
- Universal format (compatible with any platform).

### **Disadvantages**

- **Cannot be revoked** before expiration (without a separate blacklist).
- Token size grows with large Payload.
- Sensitive data cannot be stored — the token can be read (not encrypted).

### **Security Practices**

- Transmit only over **HTTPS**.
- Keep expiration time short (`exp ≈ 15 min`).
- Store the token in a **HttpOnly cookie** or secure storage.
- On logout or compromise — use a **revocation list** mechanism.
