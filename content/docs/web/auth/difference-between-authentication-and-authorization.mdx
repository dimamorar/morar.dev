title: "Authentication vs Authorization"
description: ""

> Authentication is responsible for verifying a user's identity, while authorization is for determining their rights and access level.
> These processes happen sequentially: first the system makes sure _who_ you are, then it decides _what you are allowed to do_.

### **Authentication**

- Goal: confirm **user identity**.
- Verifies credentials: login, password, token, certificate, biometrics.
- Result — creation of a session or issuance of a token.
- Example: entering login and password on the login page.
- Answers the question: **"Who are you?"**

### **Authorization**

- Goal: determine the **access level** of the user.
- Verifies roles, rights, or access policies.
- Decides which data and actions are available.
- Example: only an administrator can delete a user.
- Answers the question: **"What are you allowed to do?"**

### **Key Differences**

| Criterion          | Authentication                | Authorization                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose            | Confirmation of identity      | Determination of access rights         |
| Process Stage      | Performed first               | Follows after authentication           |
| Result             | User identified               | User granted permissions               |
| Verified via       | Login, password, token        | Roles, rights, policies                |
| Visibility to user | Usually explicit (login form) | Often implicit (limited functionality) |

### **Example**

1. A user logs in using email and password → **authentication**.
2. The system determines that they have the `editor` role and allows them to edit articles but not delete → **authorization**.
