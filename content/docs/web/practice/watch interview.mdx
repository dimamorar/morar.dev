		- + Virtual DOM
		- - React Fiber
		- - Component approach
		- - Unidirectional data flow
	- What is Virtual DOM?
		- - Reread [[Virtual DOM]]
		- - Heuristic algorithm
	- + What is `key`?
	- What React versions do you know?
		- before 16.8
		- 18
		- 19
	- Component lifecycles
		- didMount

	- Priority / Weight of selectors
		- - three-digit number id-100, .class-10, tag-1
	- position property
	- how would you implement a custom checkbox
	- pseudo class / element
		- - :first-child / last-child / disabled
	- event loop
		- stack
		- browser API
		- macroTasks
		- microTasks
		- Text
			- Infinite loop in which various browser events are executed. They are distributed into queues, micro and macro tasks. 
			- Micro include promises, queueMicrotask function, mutationObserver
			- Macro: setTimeout, timers, events.
			- Microtasks have a higher priority
			- Execution order:
				- All synchronous code
				- Micro
				- 1 macro
				- Iteration continues (Synchronous, Micro, 1 Macro)
			- Synchronous go into the callstack
			- Asynchronous go into webAPI, processed, put in callbackQueue, then into callStack
			- Asynchronous code allows executing code without blocking the thread
	- Closure
		- what it can be used for
	- React. For what is it used? What is its advantage?
	- Text:
		- Advantage: 
			- VirtualDOM 
			- Component approach 
		- Unidirectional data flow
	- Main conditions for re-render in React?
		- - context change
		- - re-render of parent component. by default leads to re-render of descendants.
	- Hooks
	- Data types
	- Scope
		- Global
		- Functional
		- Block
	- - Virtualization
	- e.target vs e.current.target
	- TS Generic
	- ?? 
	- Utility Types
		- `Omit<>`
		- `Partial<>`
		- `Pick<>`
		- - `Readonly<>`
		- - `Required<>`
