> Website performance is a set of factors that determine the loading speed, responsiveness, and smoothness of a web application. The main goal is to make interaction **fast and unnoticeable** for the user.

### Main Metrics (Navigation Timing API)

1. **Network** — time for connection establishment, DNS, TLS, resource loading.
2. **Server Response Time** — time for the server to respond to the first request.
3. **Render Blocking** — delays due to CSS/JS affecting the first paint.
4. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** — time until the first content appears.
5. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** — time until the main element of the page appears.
6. **Time To Interactive (TTI)** — the moment the page is ready for interaction.
7. **Response Latency** — response time to user actions.
8. **Smoothness** — FPS stability, smoothness of scrolling and animations.

Navigation metrics can be measured via **Navigation Timing API**, `performance.now()`, DevTools → *Performance*.

### User Perception of Time

- < **100 ms** — instantaneous (felt immediately).
- < **1 s** — comfortable.
- **1–2 s** — acceptable, but attention drops.
- **2 s** — user loses focus.
- Active waiting (loader, skeleton) is perceived better than passive.

### Key Sources of Slowdowns

1. **Network:** slow DNS, lack of cache, heavy resources.
2. **Server:** slow rendering or API response.
3. **Browser:** blocking scripts, heavy JS logic, layout/reflow.
4. **Runtime:** frequent repaints, heavy loops, inefficient events.

### Optimization Techniques

### HTTP Level

- **Minification & Compression** — minimization and `gzip` / `brotli`.
- **Caching** — `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, `Service Worker`.
- **CDN & Sprites** — reducing latency and number of requests.

### Scripts

- `async` / `defer` for non-blocking loading.
- **Code splitting** — dividing JS into chunks.
- **Lazy loading** of modules and heavy computations.
- Removing unused scripts (`Coverage` in DevTools).

### Rendering

- Inline-CSS for critical-path.
- Minimize reflow/repaint.
- Use `will-change` and `transform` instead of `top/left`.

### Images & Fonts

- Optimization of formats (`webp`, `avif`, `woff2`).
- `srcset`, `sizes`, `fetchpriority`, `loading="lazy"`.
- Minimizing the number of custom fonts.

### Preload / Prefetch / Preconnect

- `preload` — for critical resources.
- `prefetch` — for future pages.
- `preconnect` — early opening of connections.

### Analysis Tools

**High-level:**
- Lighthouse (PageSpeed Insights, DevTools Audit).

**Low-level:**
- DevTools → *Network*, *Performance*, *Rendering*, *Memory*, *Coverage*, *Profiler*.
- Metrics: `performance.timing`, `PerformanceObserver`.

### Key Ideas

- Performance = **loading speed + responsiveness + smoothness**.
- It is important to optimize not only the network but also the **runtime**.
- A UX indicator is when the user **doesn't notice** speed problems.
- Use DevTools and Lighthouse for constant control.
- Every optimization is a **struggle for milliseconds and user attention**.
