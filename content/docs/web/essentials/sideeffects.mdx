title: "Side Effects"

> Side effects are any function operations that change external state or depend on it, going beyond pure computation. They make function behavior unpredictable and complicate testing and optimization.

#### Changing External State

- Mutation of global variables, objects, or arrays.
- Writing to local storage, cache, cookies.
- DOM updates or working with interface elements.

#### Side Actions Not Related to Computation

- Logging (`console.log`).
- API calls, HTTP requests.
- Random number generation.
- Using time (`Date.now()`).

#### Unpredictability

- The function result already depends not only on arguments.
- Side effects complicate referential transparency and memoization.

### In Functional and UI Code

- Business logic functions are tried to be made pure, and side effects are moved to separate layers.
- In React, side effects are performed in `useEffect`, not during rendering.
- In Redux, side effects are not allowed in reducers — for them there are middleware (Thunk, Saga).

### Minimal Example

```js
// side effect: mutates external array
const addItem = (item) => list.push(item);

// pure: returns new array
const addItemPure = (list, item) => [...list, item];
```

### Important Notes

- Side effects are not "bad" — they are inevitable, but must be controlled and localized.
- In an interview, it is important to explain the difference between _pure logic_ and _side-effectful operations_ and why UI frameworks separate these parts.
