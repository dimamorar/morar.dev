> `git cherry-pick` transfers a specific commit from one branch to another without a full merge.

### Explanation

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Git applies the changes of the specified commit to the current branch.

Used for targeted fixes (for example, to transfer a bug fix from `develop` to `release`).
