## Git-flow

Git-flow defines a branching structure that organizes releases, features, and hotfixes.

Main branches:
- `master/main` — stable production version
- `develop` — active development
- `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` — temporary branches for tasks

The model solves the problem of chaos during parallel development and makes the release process predictable.

## Fast-forward merge

A fast-forward merge occurs when the current branch does not have its own commits and simply moves forward along the history of another branch.

If the `feature` branch was created from `main` and `main` has not changed, `git merge feature` simply shifts the `main` pointer to the last commit of `feature` — without a merge commit. The history remains linear.

## Resolving merge conflicts

A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes in the same section of code.

1. Git marks conflicting areas in the file (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
2. The developer manually selects the necessary changes and removes the markers.
3. After correction:
```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

Tools: IDE merge-tool, `git mergetool`, VS Code Merge Editor.

## Conventional Commits

This is a standard for commit message format that improves readability and history automation.

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add login API`
- `fix(ui): button color corrected`

Allows:
- generating a changelog automatically,
- understanding the context of changes through history,
- maintaining uniformity in the team.

## Reverting a pushed merge commit

To roll back an already sent merge commit, you cannot do a reset — you need a revert.

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push
```

`-m 1` indicates which branch to consider "main". Git will create a new commit that cancels the changes of the merge commit, preserving the integrity of history.

## Git stash

`git stash` temporarily saves uncommitted changes, clearing the working directory.

- `git stash` — saves changes and rolls back files
- `git stash list` — list of saved stashes
- `git stash apply` or `pop` — return changes

Useful when switching branches without losing current work.
