> `git merge` combines branches, creating a merge commit and preserving the real branching history.  
> `git rebase` rewrites history, “moving” commits to a new base to form a linear history.  
> Both tools solve the same problem — integrating changes, but with different approaches and consequences.

### 🧩 git merge

#### Essence

- Creates a **merge commit** that links two branches.
- Does not rewrite existing commits.
- Preserves a **non-linear** but accurate history.

#### When to apply

- Teamwork, shared branches.
- Need to see where branches diverged and merged.
- History should not be changed.

#### Example

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge feature/login
```

---

### 🧩 git rebase

#### Essence

- **Rewrites history**, moving commits on top of another branch.
- Forms a **linear and neat** history.
- Creates new commits (`D'`, `E'`), rather than changing old ones.

#### When to apply

- Before a merge, to “remove the noise” of history.
- Work in a local feature before push.
- When a clean chain history of changes is needed.

#### Example

```bash
git checkout feature/login
git rebase develop
```

### 🧩 Direct Comparison

- **merge**: safe, does not rewrite history → suitable for teams.
- **rebase**: clean linear history, but risky on shared branches.
- merge creates a **merge commit**, rebase — **new commits**.
- rebase can cause conflicts **step-by-step**, merge — once.

### 🧩 Infographic

#### Merge (merge history is preserved)

```
A---B---C  (main)
     \
      D---E  (feature)
             \
              F---G  (merge commit)
```

#### Rebase (linear history)

```
A---B---C---D'---E'  (feature rebased)
```

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **merge = preserve history**, **rebase = rewrite for neatness**.
- rebase cannot be performed on branches that other developers have already pulled.
- Best strategy:
    - _local work_: rebase
    - _shared branches_: merge
