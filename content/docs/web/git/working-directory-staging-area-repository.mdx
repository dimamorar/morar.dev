Git divides changes into three zones: working directory, staging area, and local repository.

- **Working directory** — real project files on disk. This is where you edit the code.
- **Staging area (index)** — a temporary area where changes are placed via `git add`.
- **Repository (.git)** — Git's internal database where commits, branches, and history are stored.

The sequence looks like this: changes → `git add` → staging → `git commit` → repository.
