`git add` indexes changes, and `git commit` saves a snapshot of the state in the repository history.

- `git add` places selected files in the staging area, calculating hashes of blob objects and writing them to the index.
- `git commit` creates a new **commit** object containing:
    - a link to the **tree** (file structure),
    - a link to the previous commit (parent),
    - metadata (author, date, message).

Each commit records the complete state of the project, not just the delta.
