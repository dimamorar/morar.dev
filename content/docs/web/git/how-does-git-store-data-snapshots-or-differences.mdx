Git stores not deltas, but full snapshots of file states at the moment of each commit.

Each commit is a **snapshot** of all files, represented as hashes (`blob`). If a file hasn't changed, Git simply points to the previous blob. In this way, high storage efficiency and instant rollbacks to any state are achieved.
