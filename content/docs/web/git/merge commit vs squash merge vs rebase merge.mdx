Merge commit preserves the full branch history, creating a separate merge commit. Squash merge combines all PR commits into one clean commit. Rebase merge rewrites feature commits on top of the main branch, forming a linear history without merge commits.

### Merge Commit

- Creates an **additional merge commit**.
- Preserves a **non-linear, but accurate history**.
- Does not rewrite existing commits → safe for the team.

**History:**
```
A---B---C---------G
     \           /
      D---E-----F
```

**Pros:**
- Full transparency of history.
- Convenient to track the origin of changes.
- Safe for shared branches.

**Cons:**
- More "noisy", branched history.

### Squash Merge

- Turns all PR commits into **one final commit**.
- Internal commits of the feature are not saved.

**History:**
```
A---B---C---X
```

**Pros:**
- Clean, concise history.
- One commit is easy to revert.
- Less "trash" in `git log`.

**Cons:**
- The internal structure of development is lost.
- No information on how the feature evolved.

### Rebase Merge

- Rewrites feature commits, "transferring" them to the new branch base.
- History becomes **linear**, no merge commit is created.

**Before:**
```
main:     A---B---C
feature:      \ D---E
```

**After:**
```
A---B---C---D'---E'
```

**Pros:**
- Clean linear history.
- All feature commits are preserved.
- Easy to read `git log`.

**Cons:**
- Rewrites history → dangerous for shared branches.
- Possible conflicts on each commit.

### When to use which strategy

**Use Merge Commit if:**
- Transparent history of branching is needed.
- There are many collaborators on the project.
- PRs are large and long-lived.
- History should not be rewritten.

**Use Squash Merge if:**
- Need to keep `main` as clean as possible.
- Feature commits are "WIP", small and unimportant.
- Functionality is often reverted.
- Team wants one commit per feature.

**Use Rebase Merge if:**
- Want a linear history without merge commits.
- Feature is local, not shared.
- Important to preserve detailed commits.
- Team is not afraid of history rewriting.

### Key Ideas

- **Merge Commit** → safe, preserves history, but makes it non-linear.
- **Squash Merge** → cleanest history, but without details.
- **Rebase Merge** → linearity + full detailing, but dangerous for shared branches.
- The right strategy depends on the team culture and history requirements.
