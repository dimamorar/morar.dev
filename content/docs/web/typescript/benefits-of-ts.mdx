TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving reliability and scalability.
## Advantages
- Static typing catches errors before runtime.
- IDEs provide better autocomplete and navigation.
- Refactoring is safer with type checks across modules.
- Modern JS features compile to compatible targets.
- Types document data shapes and APIs.
```tsx
let count: number = "5"; // type error
```
