title: "TypeScript vs JavaScript"
description: ""
---
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to JS.
## Differences
- Static typing catches errors before runtime.
- Adds interfaces, generics, and class features.
- Better IDE support via types.
- Requires compilation (`tsc`).
```tsx
let username: string = "Alex";
let age: number = 25;
```
