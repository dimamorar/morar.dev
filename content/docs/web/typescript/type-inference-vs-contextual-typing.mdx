title: "Type inference vs contextual typing"

Type inference derives types from values. Contextual typing derives types from usage.
## Type inference
```tsx
let count = 5;
const name = "Alex";
```
## Contextual typing
```tsx
window.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event.clientX);
});
```
