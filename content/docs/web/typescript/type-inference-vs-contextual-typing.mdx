### 🧩 Type Inference

- The compiler **independently determines the type** of a variable or expression if it is not explicitly specified.
- Inference is based on the assigned value or the result of the expression.

```tsx
let count = 5; // type: number
const name = "Alex"; // type: string
```

- Type inference allows avoiding unnecessary type duplication in simple cases.
- If the type cannot be determined, the compiler assigns `any` (if `noImplicitAny` is not enabled).

### 🧩 Contextual Typing

- The type is determined **based on the context** in which the value is used (in particular, functions or callbacks).
- Often applied for events, handlers, or function parameters.

```tsx
window.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event.clientX); // event: MouseEvent (inferred from context)
});
```

- In this example, the `MouseEvent` type is not explicitly declared — it is determined by the **context of the `addEventListener` method**.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **Type inference** — the type is determined **from assignment** or **expression**.
- **Contextual typing** — the type is determined **from the context of use**.
- Both mechanisms reduce the number of explicit annotations, making the code cleaner and more understandable.
