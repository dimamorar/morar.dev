title: "Abstract classes"
description: ""
---
An abstract class cannot be instantiated and acts as a base template for subclasses.
Use it to share common logic and enforce required methods.
## Example
```tsx
abstract class Shape {
  abstract getArea(): number;
  printArea() {
    console.log("Area:", this.getArea());
  }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(private radius: number) {
    super();
  }
  getArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius ** 2;
  }
}
const circle = new Circle(10);
circle.printArea();
```
## Notes
- `abstract` methods have no implementation and must be overridden.
- `new Shape()` is not allowed.
- Useful for class hierarchies with shared behavior.
