In TypeScript, `typeof` extracts a type from a value at compile time.
## Example
```tsx
const user = { id: 1, name: "Anna", active: true };
type User = typeof user;
```
## With `keyof`
```tsx
const settings = { theme: "dark", version: 3 };
type SettingsKeys = keyof typeof settings; // "theme" | "version"
```
## Classes
```tsx
class User {
  name = "Olha";
}
type UserConstructor = typeof User;
```
