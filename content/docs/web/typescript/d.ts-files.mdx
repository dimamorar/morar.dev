Declaration files describe types for code that exists at runtime but is not written in TS.
They are used for type checking only and emit no JS.
## Basics
```tsx
// globals.d.ts
declare const VERSION: string;
declare function logMessage(msg: string): void;
```
```tsx
// main.ts
console.log(VERSION);
logMessage("Hello!");
```
## External libraries
- Install community types when available.
```bash
npm i --save-dev @types/lodash
```
- Or write your own declarations.
```tsx
declare module "lodash" {
  export function chunk<T>(arr: T[], size?: number): T[][];
}
```
## Notes
- Use `declare` for external entities without implementations.
- Common for globals, untyped packages, and shared type packages.
