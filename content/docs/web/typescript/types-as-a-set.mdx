title: "Types as a set"

Types can be viewed as sets of possible values. Narrowing makes the set smaller.
## Nesting
```tsx
string[]
boolean[]
[string, number]
Array<{ size: number }>
```
## Narrowing example
```tsx
type Id = string | number;
function print(id: Id) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    id.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```
