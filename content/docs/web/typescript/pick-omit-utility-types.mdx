### 🧩 `Pick<T, K>`

- Creates a new type that includes **only selected keys** `K` from type or interface `T`.

```tsx
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

type PublicUser = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;

const user: PublicUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Anna",
};
```

### 🧩 `Omit<T, K>`

- Creates a type that **excludes specified keys** `K` from type or interface `T`.

```tsx
type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, "email">;

const u: UserWithoutEmail = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Olha",
  isAdmin: true,
};
```

### 🧩 Alternative via Own Types

You can also create a subtype manually through **intersection or type indexing**, but `Pick` and `Omit` are the most convenient and common solutions.

```tsx
type CustomUser = { id: User["id"]; name: User["name"] };
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `Pick` → select needed properties.
- `Omit` → exclude unnecessary properties.
- Both help **reduce duplication** and increase type consistency in the project.
