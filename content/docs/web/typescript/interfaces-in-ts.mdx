Interfaces describe the shape of objects and act as type contracts.
## Example
```tsx
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string;
}
const user: User = { name: "Olha", age: 28 };
```
## Features
- Optional and readonly properties.
- Can describe functions and index signatures.
```tsx
interface Add {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
```
