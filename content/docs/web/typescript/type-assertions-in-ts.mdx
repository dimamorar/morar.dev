Type assertions tell the compiler what type a value should be.
They do not change runtime values or perform checks.
## Example
```tsx
let value: unknown = "Hello TS";
let strLength = (value as string).length;
```
## Syntax
```tsx
const input = document.querySelector("input") as HTMLInputElement;
```
## Notes
- Use when you are sure of the value type.
- Prefer type guards when possible.
