Access modifiers control visibility of class members.
## `public`
```tsx
class User {
  public name: string = "Olha";
}
```
## `private`
```tsx
class Account {
  private balance: number = 1000;
}
```
## `protected`
```tsx
class Base {
  protected id: number = 1;
}
```
## Notes
- `public` is the default.
- `private` is only within the class.
- `protected` is for the class and its subclasses.
