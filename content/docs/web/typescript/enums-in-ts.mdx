Enums group related constants under one name.
## Numeric enums
```tsx
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```
## String enums
```tsx
enum Role {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
  Guest = "GUEST",
}
```
## Notes
- Numeric enums have reverse mapping.
- Heterogeneous enums are allowed but discouraged.
