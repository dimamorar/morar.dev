In Flux, the dispatcher is the central router for actions. It delivers each action to all registered stores in a controlled order.

### Why it matters
- Keeps updates sequential and predictable
- Prevents stores from talking to each other directly

### Redux difference
- Redux removes the dispatcher
- `dispatch()` and reducers handle the flow inside a single store
