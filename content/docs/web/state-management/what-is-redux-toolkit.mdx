Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to use Redux.

### What it adds
- `configureStore` with safe defaults
- `createSlice` for reducers + actions
- Immer for immutable updates
- `createAsyncThunk` and RTK Query for async/data

### Why it matters
- Less boilerplate
- Fewer mutation mistakes
- Consistent project structure
