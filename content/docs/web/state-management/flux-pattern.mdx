Flux is an architectural pattern with a strict one-way flow and clear roles.

### Core pieces
- Action: intent to change state
- Dispatcher: routes actions to stores
- Store: holds state and update logic
- View: reads state and triggers actions

### Why it exists
- Avoids two-way update chaos
- Makes updates predictable and traceable

### Compared to Redux
- Redux removes the dispatcher
- Reducers replace store-side business logic
