## Unidirectional Data Flow

> Unidirectional data flow is a model where data moves strictly in one direction: from state to UI and back through a controlled update chain.  
> It makes application behavior predictable, eliminates hidden dependencies, and simplifies debugging.

### Technical Explanation

#### **The Essence of Unidirectional Flow**

- State changes always follow a fixed route.
    
- The UI does not modify the state directly — it initiates an **action**, which is processed by the system.
    
- Every change has a clear source and a clear sequence of steps.
    

#### **The Problem of Two-way Connections**

- In classical patterns (MVC/MVVM), View and Model can update each other directly.
    
- This leads to implicit dependencies, event races, and difficulty in determining the cause of an update.
    

#### **Unidirectional flow in Flux**

- The flow is organized as:  
    **View → Action → Dispatcher → Store → View**
    
- Every change passes through the Dispatcher, which guarantees the order and delivery of the action to all Stores.
    

#### **Unidirectional flow in Redux**

- Redux simplifies the Flux model, **but the Action remains a mandatory part**.
    
- The flow looks like this:  
    **dispatch(Action) → reducer → new state → UI**
    
- The reducer calculates the new state based on the current state and action.
    
- The Store manages the state but does not contain the business logic of mutations.
    

#### **Why This is Important**

- No hidden mutations: everything starts with an action.
    
- The flow is transparent → easy to log and reproduce errors.
    
- Supports time-travel debugging, hot reload, and deterministic rendering.

### Important Notes

- Unidirectional flow does not work without immutability — the new state must be a new object.
    
- The Redux flow does not contain a Dispatcher, but the **action remains a fundamental entity**.
    
- This is one of the key principles of React/Redux architecture for large SPAs.
