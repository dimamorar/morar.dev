Unidirectional data flow means updates move one way: event → action → state update → UI. The UI never mutates state directly.

### Flow in practice
- Flux: View → Action → Dispatcher → Store → View
- Redux: dispatch(Action) → reducer → new state → UI

### Why it matters
- Clear update path and source of change
- Easier debugging and replay
- Works best with immutable updates
