Redux is a predictable state container with a strict action → reducer → state flow.

### What it gives you
- One global state tree
- Pure reducers and immutable updates
- Debuggable history with devtools

### When it fits
- Complex shared state across many views
- Need for auditability and replay
- Teams that want strict update rules
