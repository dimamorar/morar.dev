## What Problems Does Middleware Solve

> Middleware solves tasks that are impossible or incorrect to perform inside a reducer: asynchrony, side effects, logging, action control, and extending Redux behavior.  
> It makes Redux flexible while maintaining the purity and predictability of reducers.

### Technical Explanation

#### **1. Asynchronous Logic**

Redux itself is strictly synchronous.  
Middleware allows:

- performing API requests,
    
- waiting for a response,
    
- dispatching "success/error" actions,
    
- coordinating chains of asynchronous operations.
    

Without middleware, there is no asynchrony in Redux.

#### **2. Side Effects**

The reducer must be a pure function.  
Middleware handles effects:

- timers,
    
- accessing localStorage,
    
- logging,
    
- authentication,
    
- working with tokens.
    

This separates business change logic from side effects.

#### **3. Logging and Diagnostics**

Typical middleware:

- logger,
    
- crash reporting,
    
- analytics,
    
- action monitoring.
    

They allow tracking the behavior of the application without changing reducers.

#### **4. Filtering and Modifying Actions**

Middleware can:

- reject certain actions,
    
- transform the payload,
    
- add metadata.
    

This is useful for validation, normalization, and security.

#### **5. Creating New Actions**

Means like Thunk and Saga can send additional actions:

- start → success → error
    
- optimistic updates
    
- background refresh
    

This is impossible to do inside a reducer (it must be pure).

#### **6. Encapsulation of Complex Logic**

Middleware hides complexity:

- retry mechanisms,
    
- debounce/throttle of actions,
    
- request queue control.

### Important Notes

- The primary goal of middleware is to extend Redux without violating its three principles.
    
- Every action passes through ALL connected middleware.
    
- Redux Toolkit includes useful middleware by default (thunk + checks).
