Middleware handles concerns that reducers must not handle.

### Typical uses
- Async flows (requests, retries, queues)
- Side effects (timers, storage, auth)
- Logging and analytics
- Action validation and transformation

### Key constraint
- Middleware can change or stop actions, but it never changes state directly
