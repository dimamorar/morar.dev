## Single Source of Truth

> Single Source of Truth is a principle according to which the application state is stored in a **single, centralized repository**, rather than distributed across various components.  
> It ensures data consistency, simplifies UI synchronization, and guarantees predictable application behavior.

### Technical Explanation

#### **The Essence of the Principle**

- All data managed by the application is in one place.
    
- Components do not store their own versions of the global state and do not argue among themselves about "which data is correct."
    
- The UI always reflects the current state of the Store.
    

#### **Single Source of Truth in Flux**

- Each domain area has its own Store.
    
- The Store owns the single true version of data for its part of the state.
    
- All Views subscribe to the corresponding Stores and receive up-to-date data.
    

#### **Single Source of Truth in Redux**

- One global state inside a single Store.
    
- Reducers define the state structure but do not own their own copies of data.
    
- All components receive data from a single state object → this eliminates discrepancies.
    

#### **Why This is Important**

- Eliminates state duplication.
    
- Simplifies debugging: you can always see the current state.
    
- Makes application behavior deterministic: `UI = f(state)`.
    
- Allows using tools like Redux DevTools and time-travel debugging.

### Important Notes

- "Single" does not mean a "simple structure" — the state can be multi-layered and complex, but it is stored **globally and centrally**.
    
- The principle is directly related to unidirectional data flow: one store → multiple UI representations.
    
- Redux Toolkit supports this principle, even if the logic is broken into several slices.
