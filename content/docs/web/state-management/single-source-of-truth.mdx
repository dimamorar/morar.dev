title: "Single Source"

Single source of truth means there is one authoritative state for the app, not many competing copies.

### Benefits
- No data drift between components
- UI is always derived from the same state
- Debugging is simpler: one place to inspect

### In Flux vs Redux
- Flux: each domain has a store, but each store is still the single source for its domain
- Redux: one global store holds all state
