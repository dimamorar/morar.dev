## What Is the Store

> The Store is the central Redux object that holds the global state and manages its updates.  
> It accepts actions, runs the reducer, and notifies subscribers of the new state, ensuring a predictable data flow.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Store's Role**

- Holds the application's only object — **global state**.
    
- Provides three key methods:
    
    - `getState()` — get the current state
        
    - `dispatch(action)` — initiate an update
        
    - `subscribe(listener)` — subscribe to changes
    

#### **How the Store Processes Updates**

The Store implements a fixed cycle:

**Action → dispatch(action) → Middleware (optional) → Reducer → New State → Notify Subscribers**

- **dispatch** accepts an action.
    
- The action passes through a chain of middleware (if connected).
    
- The Store calls the root reducer with `(previousState, action)`.
    
- The reducer returns a new immutable state.
    
- The Store saves the new state.
    
- All subscribers are called again.
    

#### **What the Store DOES NOT Do**

- Does not contain business logic (it's in reducers).
    
- Does not change the state directly.
    
- Does not perform side effects.
    

#### **Why There is Only One Store**

- One Store = one source of truth.
    
- Ensures consistency and a predictable data flow.

### Important Notes

- The Store in Redux is not an analogue of the Flux Store: it does not update the state on its own and does not hold the logic of actions.
    
- Dispatch is a built-in Store mechanism, not a separate Dispatcher object.
    
- DevTools connect to the Store to display all state updates.
