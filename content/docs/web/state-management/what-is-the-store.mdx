The store holds the global state and coordinates updates.

### What it does
- Stores the state tree
- Exposes `getState()`, `dispatch()`, `subscribe()`
- Runs reducers and notifies listeners

### What it does not do
- No business logic (reducers handle it)
- No direct state mutation
- No side effects
