title: "Async Thunk Flow"
description: ""
---

Thunk enables async work by letting `dispatch` accept functions.

### Typical flow
1. UI dispatches a thunk
2. Thunk runs async work
3. Thunk dispatches start/success/error actions
4. Reducers update state as usual

### Why it helps
- Keeps async logic out of components
- Maintains pure reducers
