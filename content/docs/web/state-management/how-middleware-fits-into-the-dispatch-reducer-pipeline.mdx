## How Middleware Fits Into the Dispatch → Reducer Pipeline

> Middleware is inserted between `dispatch(action)` and the reducer call, forming a chain of functions through which every action passes.  
> This allows intercepting, modifying, or stopping actions before they reach the reducer.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Middleware Flow Structure**

The full action processing cycle:

**Action → dispatch → Middleware Chain → Reducer → New State**

- The UI calls `dispatch(action)`.
    
- The action is passed to the first middleware.
    
- Each middleware decides:
    
    - whether to pass the action further (`next(action)`),
        
    - modify it,
        
    - send another action,
        
    - stop the chain.
    
- At the end, the action reaches the reducer.
    

#### **Purpose of the Middleware Chain**

- Separate side effects from reducers.
    
- Provide a modular way to extend Redux behavior.
    
- Allow multiple middlewares to process one action sequentially.
    

#### **How the Chain Works**

Each middleware has the form:

```js
store => next => action
```

- `store` — access to `dispatch` and `getState`.
    
- `next` — link to the next middleware.
    
- `action` — the current action being processed.
    

This makes the pipeline transparent and manageable.

### Important Notes

- The reducer is always at the end of the chain.
- No middleware can directly change the state.
- The order of connecting middlewares determines the order of their execution.
