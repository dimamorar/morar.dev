title: "Middleware Pipeline"

Middleware sits between `dispatch` and the reducer in a chain.

### Flow
**Action → dispatch → middleware chain → reducer → new state**

### Shape
```js
store => next => action
```

### Notes
- Each middleware decides whether to pass, modify, or stop an action
- Reducers are always last
