A thunk is a function you dispatch instead of an action object. The thunk runs with `(dispatch, getState)` so it can perform async work and then dispatch actions.

### How it works
- If `dispatch` receives a function, the thunk middleware runs it
- The reducer never sees the function, only the actions it dispatches

### Why it matters
- Keeps reducers pure
- Enables async and multi-step flows
