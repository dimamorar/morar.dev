title: "State Management"

State management is how an app stores, updates, and shares data over time. It defines where state lives, who can change it, and how updates reach the UI.

### Core concerns
- Source of truth: centralized vs distributed
- Change rules: actions/reducers vs direct mutation
- Predictability and debuggability
- Sync vs async updates

### Common approaches
- Flux/Redux: explicit actions, pure reducers, unidirectional flow
- Reactive (MobX/Signals): automatic tracking and updates
- Local/component state: isolated, low overhead

### Choosing a model
- Complex shared state → explicit flow
- UI-heavy local interactions → reactive or local state
- Need auditability/time travel → Redux-style
