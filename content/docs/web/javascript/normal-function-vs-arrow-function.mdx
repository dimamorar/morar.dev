title: "Function vs Arrow"

> In JavaScript, regular functions (function declaration / expression) and arrow functions differ in context behavior, the ability to use `new`, handling of arguments, and syntax.
>
> The main difference is that arrow functions **do not have their own `this`** and **inherit the context from the outer scope**.

### 1. Context (`this`)

- **Regular function**: the value of `this` is defined **dynamically** — it depends on how the function is called.
  It can point to an object, the global context, or be `undefined` in strict mode.
- **Arrow function**: **does not have its own `this`** — it **inherits the context** from the outer lexical environment where it was declared.

### 2. Constructors

- **Regular function** can be called with `new` and create instances because it has a `prototype` property.
- **Arrow function** cannot be used as a constructor — it throws an error when called with `new`.

### 3. Arguments

- **Regular function** has a special `arguments` object containing all passed parameters.
- **Arrow function** does not have its own `arguments`; to access parameters, a **rest parameter** (`...args`) is used.

### 4. Syntax

- **Regular function** — more verbose syntax, suitable for methods, constructors, and declarations.
- **Arrow function** — short form, convenient for callbacks and nested functions.

### Key Ideas

- Arrow functions do not create their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, `new.target`.
- They are used where it's important to preserve the context from the outer function.
- Regular functions are universal — they can be called, bound (`bind`), inherited, and used as constructors.
- The choice depends on the task: **`this` behavior** is the main criterion.
