title: "How `Array.reduce()` Works"
description: ""
---

> The `reduce()` method sequentially applies a callback to each element of the array, storing the intermediate result in an **accumulator** and returning a single final value.

### Signature

```jsx
arr.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array), initialValue)
```

### How it works

1. **Accumulator** — stores the result of the previous function call.
2. **Current Value** — the element currently being processed.
3. If **`initialValue`** is specified, it is used as the initial value of the accumulator.
    If not specified — `reduce()` will take the **first element of the array** as the start, and iteration will begin from the second element.
4. In each iteration, the result of the callback is assigned to the accumulator.
5. After completing all iterations, the **final value of the accumulator** is returned.

### Example

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
// acc: 0 → 1 → 3 → 6 → 10
// sum = 10
```

### Key Features

- **Does not mutate** the original array.
- Works with **any data type** (numbers, strings, objects).
- Suitable for:
    - summing and aggregating data,
    - counting element frequency,
    - grouping by properties,
    - transforming arrays into objects.
