## Execution Context

> Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed.
> It determines which variables, functions, and objects are accessible at a specific moment of execution.

### 🧩 Types of Execution Context

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**
    - Created once when the script starts.
    - Defines global objects (`window`, `globalThis`) and the global scope.
    - Any code outside of functions is executed here.
2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**
    - Created every time a function is called.
    - For each function, its own **Lexical Environment** and `this` value are formed.
    - After the function completes, the context is destroyed (unless closed in a closure).
3. **Block Execution Context (BEC)**
    - Appeared with ES6 for `let`, `const`, `class` constructs.
    - Created for blocks `{ ... }`, loops, `if`, `try/catch`.
    - Provides block scope.

### ⚙️ Execution Phases

1. **Creation Phase**
    - A variable and function object (Variable Environment) is created.
    - **Hoisting** is performed: function and variable declarations are registered in memory.
    - The value of `this` is determined.
2. **Execution Phase**
    - Code is executed line by line.
    - Values are assigned to variables, function calls and expressions are executed.

### 🧠 Call Stack

- Each new context is placed in the **Call Stack**.
- When a function completes, its context is removed from the stack.
- The top element of the stack always corresponds to the **current execution context**.

```jsx
function a() { console.log('A'); }
function b() { a(); console.log('B'); }
b();
// Stack trace: [GEC] → [b()] → [a()]

```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Each function call creates a **new Execution Context**.
- The context defines **scope**, **this**, **hoisting**, and links to the outer environment.
- **Call Stack** manages the order of execution and return of functions.
- After a function completes, the context is removed, but can be preserved through a **closure**.
