### Function (Functional approach)

- Before classes were introduced, objects and their "types" were created through **constructor functions**.
- A function is used as a template to create objects when called with the `new` operator.
- Methods are added manually via the `prototype` property.
- This approach remains valid but is considered **low-level and less readable** compared to classes.

### Class (Class approach)

- Classes are **syntactic sugar** over constructor functions and prototypal inheritance.
- They make code **declarative, readable, and predictable**.
- They define a template with a set of properties and methods, and support inheritance via `extends`.
- They are not hoisted like functions and always execute in **strict mode**.

### Key Differences

- A class is a **modern and convenient form** of constructor functions.
- Classes have built-in support for **inheritance and methods**.
- Constructor functions require manual binding of methods via `prototype`.
- Classes cannot be called as a regular function without `new`.

> In other words, classes are a structured and safe way to create objects, while constructor functions are a more **raw mechanism** underlying this system.
