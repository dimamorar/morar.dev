> An event is a signal from the browser that an action occurred (click, input, scroll, etc.).
>
> When an event occurs, the browser **creates an event object** and **passes it to the registered handler**.

### Stages of an Event

JavaScript uses the **event flow model**, consisting of three phases:

1. **Capturing**
   - The event moves from top to bottom: `window → document → body → target`.
   - Handlers with `addEventListener(event, handler, true)` trigger at this stage.
2. **Target**
   - The event reaches the **element** where it occurred.
   - Handlers assigned directly to this element are executed.
3. **Bubbling**
   - The event moves back up the DOM — from the target to `window`.
   - Handlers without the third argument (or with `false` by default) trigger at this stage.

### Event Transmission Mechanism

When an event occurs:

- The browser creates an **`Event` object** containing information about type, target, coordinates, keys, etc.
- This object is passed to the handler function.
- Inside the handler, methods and properties are available:
  - `event.stopPropagation()` — stops further bubbling.
  - `event.preventDefault()` — cancels the standard browser action.
  - `event.target` — the element where the event actually occurred.
  - `event.currentTarget` — the element where the handler is currently executing (always equals `this` in the handler).

**Example:**

```javascript
div.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.target; // Can be <button> (if clicked on a button inside)
  e.currentTarget; // Always <div> (element with addEventListener)
});
```

### Key Ideas

- Events propagate **down (capturing)** and **up (bubbling)** through the DOM tree.
- The ability to control propagation makes the event model **flexible and efficient**.
- **Bubbling** allows for event delegation — handling multiple elements through one parent.
- The event mechanism is at the heart of DOM interactivity.
