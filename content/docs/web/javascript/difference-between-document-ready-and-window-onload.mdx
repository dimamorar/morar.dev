title: "document.ready() vs window.onload()"
description: ""

> Both methods are used to execute code after the page has loaded, but they differ in the **timing of the event**.
> `document.ready()` fires when the **DOM** is loaded, while `window.onload()` fires when **all page resources** (images, styles, fonts, etc.) are loaded.

### `document.ready()` / `DOMContentLoaded`

- Fires when the browser has **built the DOM tree**, but external resources (images, styles) may still be loading.
- Used for initializing the interface and scripts that only require the ready DOM structure.
- Happens **earlier** than `window.onload()`, so the page becomes interactive faster.

Modern syntax (without jQuery):

```jsx
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", callback);
```

### `window.onload()`

- Fires when **all page content has loaded**, including images, styles, fonts, iframes, and other resources.
- Used when work with elements depending on external data is required (for example, calculating image sizes).
- Happens **later** than `DOMContentLoaded`.

Modern syntax:

```jsx
window.addEventListener("load", callback);
```

### Key Differences

| Feature                     | `document.ready()` / `DOMContentLoaded`              | `window.onload()`                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger Timing**          | After DOM construction                               | After all resources load               |
| **Wait for External Files** | ❌ No                                                | ✅ Yes                                 |
| **Typical Scenarios**       | UI initialization, DOM manipulations                 | Working with images, layout            |
| **Response Speed**          | Faster                                               | Slower                                 |
| **Modern Analogue**         | `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ...)` | `window.addEventListener('load', ...)` |

### Key Ideas

- `DOMContentLoaded` makes the page interactive **earlier** than `load`.
- For most UI tasks, `DOMContentLoaded` is used.
- `window.onload` is useful if you need to wait for the **full content load**.
- Both events can be used together if different parts of the logic require different stages of document readiness.
