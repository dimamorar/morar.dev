> Context (execution context) is the value pointed to by the `this` keyword during code execution.
> 
> Context defines the **owner object** within which the function was called and is set **dynamically at call time**.

### Context vs Scope

- **Scope** is defined **at function declaration** (lexically).
- **Context** is set **at function call** (dynamically).
- Context is **not related** to scope — `this` does not point to variables from the lexical environment.

### Context Types

1. **Global Context**
    
    When code runs outside a function — `this` points to the global object (`window` in the browser, `global` in Node.js).
    
2. **Function Context**
    - Regular call: `this` = `undefined` (in strict mode) or the global object.
    - Method call: `this` refers to the object.
3. **Constructor Context**
    
    When using `new`, `this` points to the **new object instance**.
    
4. **Manual Context Control**
    
    Context can be explicitly set using **`call()`**, **`apply()`**, **`bind()`**.

### Key Ideas

- Context describes the **binding of a function to an object at the moment of invocation**.
- Defined **dynamically**, unlike scope.
- When context is lost (e.g., passing a method as a callback), `bind()` can be used to fix `this`.
- Proper context management is critical when working with classes, event handlers, and object methods.
