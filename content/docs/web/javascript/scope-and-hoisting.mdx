### Scope

- **Function Scope** — variables declared with `var` are visible only inside the function.
- **Block Scope** — variables declared with `let` and `const` are accessible only within the `{ ... }` block.

When creating a scope, the engine forms a **Lexical Environment** — an internal structure where links to identifiers and their values are stored.

Each environment is linked to an external one, forming a **Scope Chain**.

### Hoisting

- During the **compilation phase**, variable and function declarations are registered in memory before code execution.
- For `var`, the declaration is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- For `let` and `const`, declarations are hoisted but remain in the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** until initialization.
- **Function declarations** are hoisted completely (both name and function body), so they can be called before declaration.

### Key Idea

- Scope defines **boundaries of variable accessibility**.
- Hoisting explains **why access is possible before declaration**.
- Lexical Environment forms the basis for the **scope chain and closures**.
- `TDZ` prevents the use of `let` and `const` before their initialization.

> The Lexical Environment lies at the core of the Closures mechanism — functions in JavaScript remember their environment and can access variables from the outer scope even after it has completed.
