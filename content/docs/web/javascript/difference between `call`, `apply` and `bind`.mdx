title: "Difference between `call`, `apply` and `bind`"
description: ""

> The methods `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are used for manual management of the context (`this`) of a function. They are available to all functions through the `Function.prototype` prototype.

### `call()`

- Calls the function **immediately**, passing `this` and arguments **separated by commas**.
- Used when you need to call a function with a specific context right now.

```jsx
func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

### `apply()`

- Similar to `call()`, but arguments are passed **in the form of an array or pseudo-array**.
- Convenient when arguments are already in an array (for example, when using `Math.max`).

```jsx
func.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...]);
```

### `bind()`

- **Does not call the function immediately**, but **returns a new function** with a fixed `this` and (optionally) partially set arguments.
- Used for **deferred call** or **permanent context binding**, for example, in event handlers.

```jsx
const newFunc = func.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

### Key Ideas

- `call` and `apply` — **execute** the function immediately, with different ways of passing arguments.
- `bind` — **does not execute** immediately, but returns a new function.
- All three methods allow explicit management of the execution context (`this`).
- Typical case: loss of context when passing a method as a callback.
