> `var`, `let`, and `const` define variables with different scopes, hoisting behavior, and re-declaration capabilities.

### `var`

- Functional scope.
- Hoisting with initialization to `undefined`.
- Allows re-definition and re-declaration.
- Considered obsolete in modern JS.

```jsx
var name = "Alex";
var name = "Oleh"; // allowed
```

### `let`

- Block scope.
- Subject to hoisting but falls into the **TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)** until initialization → accessing the declaration causes an error.
- Can be changed but cannot be re-declared in the same block.

```jsx
let age = 25;
age = 30;
```

### `const`

- Block scope.
- Also has **TDZ until initialization**.
- Mandatory initialization upon declaration.
- Cannot be re-defined, but the contents of objects and arrays can be changed (without changing the reference).

```jsx
const user = { name: "Anna" };
user.name = "Olha";
```

### Key Ideas

- `var` — hoisting + undefined + function scope.
- `let`/`const` — block scope + TDZ until initialization.
- `let` changes, `const` — does not, but objects remain mutable.
