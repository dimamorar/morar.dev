### 🧩 Technical Explanation

Currying transforms a function of the type:

```
f(a, b, c) → f(a)(b)(c)
```

Each call returns a **new function** that expects the next argument.

When all parameters are passed, the original function body is executed.

```jsx
function multiply(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

const double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

```

📘 `multiply(2)` returns an internal function that remembers the value `a = 2` and waits for `b`.

This is achieved through a **closure** — the internal function maintains access to the variables of the external one.

### ⚙️ Currying Application

- **Partial application**
    
    You can fix some of the arguments in advance and reuse the function:
    
    ```jsx
    const add = a => b => a + b;
    const add10 = add(10);
    add10(5); // 15
    
    ```
    
- **Function Composition**
    
    Simplifies combining small pure functions into complex chains.
    
- **Logic Reuse**
    
    Allows creating specialized functions from universal templates.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- Currying creates a **chain of functions**, each returning a new one until all arguments are applied.
- Based on **closures**, which preserve the argument context.
- Simplifies the **composition and reuse** of functions.
- Often used in **functional programming** and libraries like Lodash, Ramda.
