title: "Prototype Chain & Inheritance"

> Prototypal inheritance is a mechanism by which objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from each other through a chain of `[[Prototype]]` links.  
> It is at the core of the object model and the implementation of classes (`class`).

### Prototype Chain

- Every object has an internal `[[Prototype]]` link pointing to another object or `null`.
- When an object's property is accessed, the engine looks for it first **in the object itself**, then **along the prototype chain** until it reaches `Object.prototype` or `null`.
- This mechanism is called **property delegation**.

```jsx
const animal = { eats: true };
const dog = Object.create(animal);
console.log(dog.eats); // true — found in the prototype
```

If a property is not found, `undefined` is returned, and the search continues up the chain.

### `Function.prototype` and Objects created via `new`

- Every function in JS has a `prototype` property — an object used as a prototype for instances created via `new`.
- When `new` is called, a new object is created, and its `[[Prototype]]` is linked to `Constructor.prototype`.

```jsx
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
User.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  return `Hi, ${this.name}`;
};

const user = new User('Alex');
user.sayHi(); // 'Hi, Alex'
```

`user.__proto__ === User.prototype` → `true`.

### Inheritance in Classes

- The `extends` keyword establishes a link between class prototypes.
- The `super` method allows calling the constructor and methods of the parent class.

```jsx
class Animal {
  speak() { return 'Sound'; }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() { return super.speak() + ' Woof'; }
}
new Dog().speak(); // 'Sound Woof'
```

Classes are **syntactic sugar** over prototypal inheritance.

### Useful methods for working with prototypes

- `Object.create(proto)` — creates an object with the specified prototype.
- `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` — returns the current prototype of the object.
- `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)` — changes the prototype of an object.
- `obj.hasOwnProperty(key)` — checks if the property belongs to the object itself, not the prototype.

### Key Ideas

- **Prototype** — the base object from which other objects are inherited.
- **Prototype chain** provides the search for properties up the chain.
- **Classes (`class`)** — a wrapper over prototypes that adds syntactic clarity.
- **Object.prototype** — the root of the entire chain; followed by `null`.
- Changes in the prototype are reflected in all objects inherited from it.
