## How to Iterate Array of Promises

> Iterating through an array of promises can be done in parallel or sequentially, depending on the application logic.
> The loop determines the order of calls, but **does not guarantee the order of completion**.

### 🧩 1. Parallel Execution

All promises start **simultaneously**, and the result is awaited through `Promise.all()`.
The most efficient way if operations are **independent** of each other.

```jsx
const urls = ["a.json", "b.json", "c.json"];
const promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));
const results = await Promise.all(promises);
console.log(results);

```

📘 All `fetch()` calls start in parallel, and `Promise.all()` waits for all to complete.
If one promise fails — the entire chain is rejected.

---

### 🧩 2. Sequential Execution

If it's necessary for operations to be performed **strictly in order**, `for...of` in combination with `await` is used.

```jsx
const urls = ["a.json", "b.json", "c.json"];

for (const url of urls) {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  console.log("Fetched:", url);
}

```

📘 Each `fetch()` starts **only after** the previous one completes.
Useful when the result of the next operation depends on the previous one.

---

### ⚠️ 3. Error when using `forEach`

The `forEach()` method **does not handle `await` correctly**, as it doesn't return a promise and doesn't wait for async operations to complete.

```jsx
urls.forEach(async (url) => {
  const res = await fetch(url); // executed in parallel, but not awaited
  console.log(url);
});

```

📘 Despite `await`, execution is not synchronized.
For order control, use `for...of` or `for await...of`.

---

### 🧠 4. Combined Approach (Batch processing)

You can combine approaches — run **parts of tasks in parallel**, while groups are performed **sequentially**.

```jsx
const chunks = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]];

for (const group of chunks) {
  const results = await Promise.all(group.map(processItem));
  console.log("Batch done:", results);
}

```

📘 Promises within a group are executed in parallel, while groups are executed sequentially. This is the **optimal balance** between speed and control.

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `Promise.all()` — best option for **independent async operations**.
- `for...of` with `await` — for **strictly sequential** execution.
- `forEach()` does not manage asynchrony and **is not suitable for `await`**.
- Combined approach (batching) allows controlling the **degree of parallelism**.
- All promise handlers (`then`, `catch`) go into the **microtask queue** of the Event Loop.
