> A prototype is an object from which other objects can inherit properties and methods.  
> Every object in JavaScript has an internal link `[[Prototype]]`, which points to another object or `null`.

### Prototype Chain

- If a property is not found in an object, the search continues through its prototype chain.
- This chain forms the inheritance mechanism known as the **prototype chain**.
- The end of the chain is `Object.prototype`, after which comes `null`.

```jsx
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
```

### Constructor Functions and `prototype`

- Every function in JS has a `prototype` property.
- Objects created via `new` inherit properties and methods from `Function.prototype`.

```jsx
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
User.prototype.sayHi = function() {
  return `Hi, ${this.name}`;
};

const user = new User('Alex');
console.log(user.sayHi()); // 'Hi, Alex'
```

### `Object.create()`

Creates a new object with the specified prototype:

```jsx
const person = { greet() { return 'Hello'; } };
const user = Object.create(person);
console.log(user.greet()); // 'Hello'
```

### Key Idea

- A prototype is a **mechanism for delegating properties**.
- All objects inherit from `Object.prototype` unless specified otherwise.
- The prototype model is at the core of classes (`class`) and inheritance in modern JavaScript.
