> The `==` and `===` operators compare values in JavaScript, but differ in whether **type conversion is performed** before the comparison.
> `==` performs **implicit conversion**, while `===` requires a **strict match** of both type and value.

### How it works

JavaScript can **automatically** or **manually** convert values from one type to another (type coercion).
This affects the result when using the comparison operators.

### When conversion occurs

- **Implicit:**
  Happens automatically during operations with different types:
  `'5' + 2 → "52"`, `5 + '2' → "52"`, `5 * '2' → 10`.
- **Explicit:**
  When conversion is performed manually:
  `Number('5')`, `String(123)`, `Boolean(0)`.

### Key Differences

- `==` compares values **with type conversion**.
  Example: `5 == '5' // true`
- `===` compares values **without type conversion** (strict comparison).
  Example: `5 === '5' // false`
- It is recommended to always use `===` to avoid non-obvious results and logic errors.
