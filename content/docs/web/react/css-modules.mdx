> CSS Modules is an approach where styles are stored in separate `.module.css` files, and classes are automatically hashed for uniqueness.
> This provides traditional CSS syntax with guaranteed style isolation and no runtime cost.

### Core Concept
- Each `.module.css` file is compiled into a JS object.
- Class names are automatically converted to unique ones (e.g., `button_primary__a1b2c`).
- Isolation is provided at the build-time level — styles do not conflict between components.
- Fully compatible with Next.js, Webpack, Vite.

### Advantages
- **Zero runtime cost** — all styles are gathered during the build.
- Familiar CSS syntax with full support for all features (media queries, pseudo-classes).
- Simple integration into Next.js App Router and better performance compared to CSS-in-JS.
- Support for composition (`composes:`) and local/global scope.

### Disadvantages
- Limited dynamism: conditional styles are made by changing classes, not through CSS-in-JS logic.
- Style code is not located inside the component → less co-location.
- Discipline in structuring is required (e.g., `Component.module.css`).

### Minimal Example

```jsx
import styles from './button.module.css';

<button className={styles.primary}>OK</button>
```

### Typical Use Cases
- Component styling in Next.js (especially App Router).
- Large applications where performance and a predictable CSS pipeline are important.
- Components with fixed or static styles.

### Important Notes
- Recommended as the **default solution** for Next.js App Router due to performance and simplicity.
- Avoids runtime generation of styles, so it works better on weak client devices.
