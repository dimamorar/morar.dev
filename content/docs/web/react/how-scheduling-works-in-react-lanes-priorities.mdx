> The React Scheduler determines which updates should be performed first, which can wait, and when rendering should be suspended or restored.
> In modern React, this is implemented through a system of **lanes (priority bands)** built on top of Fiber.

### Why React needs scheduling

- The UI must remain responsive even under load.
    
- Some updates are critical (text input), others are secondary (list filtering).
    
- React must decide:
    
    - what to render immediately,
        
    - what to render in the background,
        
    - what can be canceled/recomputed.
        

Scheduling is the basis of **concurrent rendering**.

### What are lanes

**Lane** is a "priority band" that React assigns to each update.

Examples (simplified):

- **Sync Lane** — immediate updates (click, focus, text input).
    
- **Default Lane** — regular interface updates.
    
- **Transition Lane** — background updates (`startTransition`).
    
- **Idle Lane** — low-priority tasks.
    

Updates from different lanes can be performed separately, at different moments.

---

### How prioritization works

1. React receives an event or state change.
    
2. Assigns a lane to the update according to the type of work.
    
3. The scheduler chooses the lane with the **highest available priority**.
    
4. Starts the render phase for the corresponding Fiber nodes.
    
5. If an update with a higher priority arises →  
    **current work is suspended and put in a queue**.

### When React suspends work

- when the time allocated for the frame (deadline) has passed,
    
- when a high-priority event arrives,
    
- when the browser signals that the thread needs to be released  
    (via `MessageChannel` or `scheduler`).
    

React "yields" control to the browser:

```txt
render → yield → browser tasks → continue render
```

---

### The role of transitions

Updates wrapped in `startTransition` receive **low priority**.

Example:

```jsx
startTransition(() => {
  setFilteredItems(expensiveFilter(query));
});
```

- user input → high priority
    
- filtering → low priority
    

React guarantees UI smoothness.

### Scheduler tools

- **cooperative scheduling** — React divides work into small parts
    
- **interruption** — work can be interrupted
    
- **resume** — work can be continued
    
- **restart** — work can be restarted
    
- **lanes merging** — several lanes can be merged if it is optimal

### Key ideas

- lanes = mechanism of update priorities in React.
    
- React performs updates with the highest priority first.
    
- Work can be suspended or restarted.
    
- Scheduling makes possible:
    
    - concurrent rendering,
        
    - Suspense,
        
    - transitions,
        
    - optimal UX without freezes.
