title: "Why Replace Reconciliation"

### How old reconciliation worked

- React recursively traversed the element tree **from top to bottom**.
    
- Each component was rendered synchronously until all work was completed.
    
- While rendering was in progress → the **JavaScript-browser thread was blocked**.
    
- The UI could not update or accept user interaction.

---

### Core limitations of the stack-based approach

#### **1. Blocking rendering**

- A large component or a large tree blocked the UI for the duration of the calculations.
    
- The page could "freeze" for tens of milliseconds.

#### **2. No update priorities**

- Updating a list of 10,000 elements and an `onInput` event had the same priority.
    
- React couldn't say: "wait, I'll process the user input first."

#### **3. Impossible to pause or resume work**

- Each render had to be completed fully.
    
- Once a component started rendering → React _could not stop_ until it finished the entire branch of the tree.

#### **4. Impossible to cancel work**

- If props changed during render —  
    React continued working on the old version of the tree.

#### **5. Impossible to distribute work between frames**

- Updates were executed in one "cycle," regardless of load.
    
- The browser could not insert animation or interaction between them.

### Consequences

- "laggy" interface on complex pages;
    
- freezing during large list updates;
    
- impossibility of making Concurrent Rendering;
    
- impossibility of making Suspense for data;
    
- impossibility of implementing priorities (high/low priority work).

These limitations made React **unsuitable** for complex UIs with many simultaneous events and updates.

### Key ideas

- The old algorithm was **synchronous, recursive, and non-interruptible**.
    
- It did not allow updates to be queued by priority.
    
- Rendering could not be paused, resumed, or canceled.
    
- This was the main reason for creating **React Fiber** — the new rendering engine.
