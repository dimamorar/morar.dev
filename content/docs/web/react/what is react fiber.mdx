### Essence of React Fiber

- Fiber is a **rewritten React rendering mechanism** that represents each component as a separate object (_fiber node_).
    
- The main goal is to give React the ability to:
    
    - **pause** rendering,
        
    - **resume** it,
        
    - **cancel** work,
        
    - **assign priorities** to updates,
        
    - **distribute work between frames** (cooperative scheduling).
        

- Fiber is not a standalone framework, but an **architectural level within React**.

### What exactly did Fiber change

- Transitioned from a recursive stack traversal to an **iterative algorithm** with its own loop.
    
- Allowed React to work "in parts" (incremental rendering).
    
- Added the ability to **process updates with different priority levels** ("lanes").
    
- Created the foundation for:
    
    - Concurrent Rendering,
        
    - Suspense,
        
    - Transitions (`useTransition`),
        
    - Automatic batching.

### How Fiber organizes the component tree

- The old DOM/React Tree has been replaced by the **Fiber Tree** — a set of Fiber nodes.
    
- Each Fiber corresponds to one component or DOM element.
    
- Fiber nodes link to each other via:
    
    - `child`,
        
    - `sibling`,
        
    - `return` (parent).
    

This way, React can move through the tree **like a singly linked list**, rather than recursively.

### Key ideas

- React Fiber = a new rendering engine, not a new API.
    
- The main goal is incremental, interruptible work with priorities.
    
- Fiber allows React to keep the UI smooth and responsive under load.
    
- All modern functionality (Concurrent Mode, Suspense, transitions) is based on Fiber.
