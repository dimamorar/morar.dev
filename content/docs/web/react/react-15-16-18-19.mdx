### React 15 — class-based, sync React

- The only full-fledged component model — **classes**
- State and side effects are managed through lifecycle methods
- Reconciliation — **stack reconciler** (fully synchronous)
- Functional components — only presentational
- Logical composition is impossible without HOC / render props

React 15 scales poorly due to a rigid lifecycle model and lack of logical reuse.

---
### React 16 — Fiber and the emergence of hooks (16.8)

- **Fiber reconciler** introduced — the basis for async / interruptible rendering
- Classes and functional components coexist
- React 16.8:
    - **Hooks** appear
    - functional components become stateful
- Logic is moved from lifecycle to hooks
- Beginning of **class → function** migration

Hooks solve the problems of lifecycle chaos and make logic compositional.

---
### React 18 — hooks-first, concurrent React
- **Functional components + hooks** — the standard
- Classes are supported but considered legacy
- **Concurrent Rendering** introduced (opt-in)
- Automatic batching for sync and async updates
- New hooks for priority management:
    - `useTransition`
    - `useDeferredValue`
- New root API — `createRoot`

React 18 allows React to **manage update priorities** rather than just re-rendering.

---
### React 19 — server-first, full-stack React
- Consolidates server-centric model
- Introduces **React Actions** for mutations
- Built-in form state management:
    - `useFormState`
    - `useFormStatus`
- Deeper integration with Server Components
- Less client-side JavaScript

React 19 shifts React from a UI library to an **application abstraction layer** (UI + data + mutations).

---
### Key Evolution (1 sentence for an interview)
React 15 — class & sync →  
React 16.8 — hooks →  
React 18 — concurrent rendering →  
React 19 — server-first full-stack React.
