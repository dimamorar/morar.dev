### Key Problems Fiber Solves

#### **1. Inability to interrupt rendering**

The old renderer blocked the main thread until all work was completed.  
Fiber allows:

- pausing work,
    
- yielding control to the browser,
    
- resuming an incomplete update.
    

This prevents UI "freezes."

---

#### **2. Lack of Update Priorities**

Previously, all updates were equal.  
Fiber introduces a **scheduler** and **priorities (lanes)**:

- high-priority updates (user input),
    
- low-priority updates (rendering lists, background tasks).
    

React decides what is more important to execute now.

---

#### **3. Inability to Cancel Work**

If data changed during render, React could not stop the current process.  
Fiber allows:

- **discarding** work,
    
- **re-calculating** it with new input data.
    

---

#### **4. Lack of Incremental Rendering**

The old approach required rendering the entire tree branch in one large cycle.  
Fiber splits work into **small units of work**, processing them in stages.

---

#### **5. Inability to Distribute Work Between Frames (time slicing)**

The browser could not insert its tasks (painting, scrolling, events).  
Fiber allows React to "yield control," which makes the UI smooth.

---

#### **6. Inability to Create Concurrent Rendering and Suspense**

Without interruption, resumption, and priorities, these features are impossible.  
Fiber became the base for:

- Concurrent rendering,
    
- Suspense for data fetching,
    
- Transitions,
    
- Automatic batching.

### Key ideas

- Fiber solves all the problems of the old synchronous renderer.
    
- It allows React not to block the UI, working in parts and by priority.
    
- It is the foundation of all modern React 18+ features.
    
- The goal of Fiber is to **make React adaptive, asynchronous, and smooth** for the user.
