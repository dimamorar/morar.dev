> Context API is a built-in React mechanism for passing data through a component tree without having to pass props manually. It solves the *prop drilling* problem, making common values (theme, language, authorization) available at any level of the hierarchy.

---

### What is Context

- Context creates a **global store** for the React tree.
- It consists of three elements:
    1. **`React.createContext(defaultValue)`** — creates a context object.
    2. **`<Context.Provider>`** — provides a value for all descendants.
    3. **`useContext(Context)`** — allows child components to get the current value.

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <Button theme={theme} />;
}

```

### How Context Works

- All components located **inside a Provider** subscribe to changes in the context value.
- When `value` is updated, React re-renders only the **subscribed components**.
- Components outside a Provider use `defaultValue`.

---

### Typical Use Cases

- **Theming (Theme switching)**
```jsx
<ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">...</ThemeContext.Provider>
```

- **User Authorization (AuthContext)**
```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider value={user}>...</AuthContext.Provider>
```

- **Localization Settings (LanguageContext)**
```jsx
<LanguageContext.Provider value="en">...</LanguageContext.Provider>
```

---

### Limitations and Best Practices
- Frequent context updates can cause **redundant re-renders**.
- It is better to split contexts by responsibility zones (theme, language, data).
- For complex state, it is better to use **Redux** or **Zustand**.
- Do not use Context for temporary or frequently changing data.

---

### Key ideas
- Context API eliminates the need for *prop drilling*.
- `Provider` defines the data source, `useContext` — the consumer.
- Works at the React tree level, not the global state level of the application.
- Effective for **global, rarely changing settings** (theme, language, session).
