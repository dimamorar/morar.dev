> In React, there are two ways to work with forms — controlled and uncontrolled.
> They differ in who manages the input state: React or the DOM itself.

### Controlled Components

- The form element state is completely controlled by React.
- The element value (`value`, `checked`, etc.) is stored in **state**, and updates happen via `onChange`.
- The true source of data is the **component state**, not the DOM.

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  return (
    <input
      value={name}
      onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}

```

**Advantages:**

- Full control over the value.
- Validation and formatting "on the fly".
- Easy tracking of changes.

**Disadvantages:**

- Re-render on every value change.
- Slightly more code.

### Uncontrolled Components

- The element value is stored **inside the DOM**, not in React state.
- `ref` is used to access data.

```jsx
function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  const handleSubmit = () => console.log(inputRef.current.value);
  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}

```

**Advantages:**

- Minimum re-renders.
- Suitable for simple or legacy forms.

**Disadvantages:**

- No direct control over state.
- Harder to do validation and synchronization.

### Key ideas

- **Controlled** — React owns the value; every change triggers a state update.
- **Uncontrolled** — DOM stores the value, React only accesses it through `ref`.
- Controlled components are the standard for most React applications.
- Uncontrolled are suitable for simple cases or integration with third-party libraries.
