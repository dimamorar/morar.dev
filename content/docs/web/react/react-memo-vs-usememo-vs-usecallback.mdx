> Memoization in React is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders and repeated calculations. It allows "remembering" the results of functions, computations, and components between renders if their dependencies have not changed.

---

### React.memo

- HOC (Higher-Order Component) that **memoizes the render result of a functional component**.
- If props have not changed (shallow comparison `shallowEqual`), the component will not be re-rendered.

```jsx
const UserCard = React.memo(function UserCard({ name }) {
  console.log("Render");
  return <div>{name}</div>;
});
```

```jsx
<UserCard name="Alex" /> // first render
<UserCard name="Alex" /> // repeated call will not lead to a re-render

```

**Optional:** you can pass a comparison function for more precise control:

```jsx
React.memo(Component, (prevProps, nextProps) => prevProps.id === nextProps.id);
```

---

### useMemo

- A hook that **caches the result of computations** between renders.
- Computations are performed only if dependencies have changed.
- Useful for heavy operations or data filtering.

```jsx
const visibleItems = useMemo(
  () => items.filter((item) => item.visible),
  [items]
);
```

Note: Do not use `useMemo` for every calculation — only if it is really expensive.

---

### useCallback

- Memoizes the **reference to a function** so it's not re-created on every render.
- Especially important when passing callbacks to child components wrapped in `React.memo`.

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  setCount((c) => c + 1);
}, []);
```

Without `useCallback`, every new render creates a new function → the child component considers the prop changed and re-renders.

### Connection Between Them

| Tool            | What it memoizes             | When to apply                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **React.memo**  | Component (render result)    | Optimizing render of child components       |
| **useMemo**     | Computed value               | Heavy operations, filtering, sorting         |
| **useCallback** | Function                     | Passing callbacks to `React.memo`-components |

---

### Key ideas

- Memoization = **remembering the result** between renders.
- `React.memo` prevents unnecessary renders.
- `useMemo` saves calculations, `useCallback` — prevents re-creation of functions.
- Use with wisdom: excessive memoization can complicate code and reduce readability.
