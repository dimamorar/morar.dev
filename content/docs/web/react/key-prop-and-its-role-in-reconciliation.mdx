### Why `key` is needed

- During render of lists, React compares the old and new Virtual DOM tree.
- Without `key` it is guided only by **element positions**, which can lead to erroneous re-renders.
- `key` gives React a stable way to map elements between renders.

```jsx
{users.map(user => (
  <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />
))}

```

### How Reconciliation works with keys

**1. If `key` matches** → React **reuses the element** and updates only changed props.

**2. If `key` is different** → React considers the element new and **removes the old one**, creating a new DOM node.

Example:

```jsx
// Old list
[{ key: 1, name: 'Alex' }, { key: 2, name: 'Bob' }]

// New list
[{ key: 2, name: 'Bob' }, { key: 1, name: 'Alex' }]

```

Without keys, React will simply change the order of elements;

with keys, it will understand that the data has swapped places, rather than being replaced.

### Incorrect Use

- Bad: Using the array index (`key={index}`) during dynamic changes:
    - leads to state desynchronization (for example, inputs lose focus).
- Bad: Random or unstable keys (`Math.random()`).
    - React cannot map elements between renders → recreates them every time.

---

### Best Practices

- Use **unique and stable keys** (`id`, `uuid`, constant slug).
- The key must be **unique among neighbors**, not globally.
- In nested lists, keys must be unique **within each level**.

---

### Key ideas

- `key` is part of the internal Reconciliation mechanism.
- Helps React precisely determine which elements need to be updated.
- Stable keys = fewer unnecessary DOM updates.
- Incorrect keys → loss of state and incorrect UI behavior.
