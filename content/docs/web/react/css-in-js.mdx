## CSS-in-JS

> CSS-in-JS is an approach where styles are described and managed via JavaScript/TypeScript code instead of separate `.css` files.  
> The library generates unique CSS classes and injects them into the DOM (often via `<style>`), providing isolation and dynamic styling.

### Concept of CSS-in-JS

- Styles live in the same module as the component (co-location).
    
- Styles are described as:
    
    - JS objects,
        
    - template literals,
        
    - functions that accept props / theme.
        
- Under the hood, unique class names are generated and added to the DOM during rendering.
    

### Advantages

- **Style isolation**: no global class conflicts.
    
- **Dynamic styles**: values depend on props, state, theme, breakpoints.
    
- **Better modularity**: component styles and logic are located together.
    
- **Typing** (in TypeScript) for theme and style-related props.
    

### Disadvantages and Costs

- **Runtime overhead**: style generation in the browser (or on the server during SSR).
    
- Possible **performance** issues in large applications with many styles.
    
- Dependency on a specific library (Emotion, Styled-components, JSS, etc.).
    
- Not always obvious integration with existing CSS pipelines (PostCSS, Tailwind, BEM).
    

### Common Use Scenarios

- Apps with highly dynamic UIs (themes, modifications via props).
    
- Design systems where components have many style variants.
    
- Projects where strict encapsulation and component-level style control are important.
    

### Minimal Example

```jsx
const buttonStyle = (primary) => ({
  padding: '8px 12px',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  backgroundColor: primary ? 'blue' : 'gray',
  color: 'white',
});

// The library then converts the object into a CSS class and applies it to the element
```

### Important Notes

- In modern frameworks (React + Next.js), you should prefer solutions that **compile styles at build-time** rather than generating them at runtime.
    
- In interviews, people often ask: _"What are the trade-offs of CSS-in-JS compared to CSS Modules / Tailwind?"_ — you should be able to mention performance and runtime complexity.
