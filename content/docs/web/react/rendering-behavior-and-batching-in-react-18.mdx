> In React 18, the principle of how the render works and how state updates are combined (batching) has changed.
> The new architecture makes updates asynchronous and optimized, maintaining interface responsiveness even with a large number of events.

### What is batching

- **Batching** is the grouping of multiple `setState` calls into a single render pass.
- React groups updates to **minimize the number of re-renders**.
- Before React 18, batching worked **only inside React events** (e.g., `onClick`).

```jsx
// React 17
setCount(c => c + 1);
setVisible(v => !v);
// two separate renders

```

---

### Automatic batching in React 18

- With React 18, batching is applied **everywhere**:
    - inside promises,
    - timers (`setTimeout`),
    - `fetch` callbacks,
    - any asynchronous operations.

```jsx
// React 18
setTimeout(() => {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setVisible(v => !v);
  // one common render
});

```

**Result:** both updates are combined into one commit → fewer repaints, higher performance.

---

### Rendering and Priorities

- React 18 introduces **asynchronous (concurrent) rendering**.
- Now updates can:
    - **be suspended and resumed** (cooperative rendering),
    - have **different priority** depending on the type of event.
- React decides exactly when to apply updates so the interface doesn't block.

---

### Synchronous and Asynchronous Updates

- **Synchronous** — important user actions (text input, clicks).
- **Asynchronous** — background updates, such as data preloading.
- React performs them **in different "lane" threads** (within Fiber).

---

### Key ideas

- React 18 combines all updates into a single render cycle — **automatic batching**.
- Rendering has become **asynchronous and prioritized**, reducing interface lags.
- The concept of batching is directly related to **Fiber** and **Concurrent Rendering**.
- This is a step towards the smoothest and most adaptive UI rendering under load.
