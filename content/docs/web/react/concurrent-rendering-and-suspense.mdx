> Concurrent Rendering is a new rendering model in React 18 based on the Fiber architecture.
> It allows React to suspend, resume, and cancel updates, making the interface responsive even during heavy computations or data loading.

### Concurrent Rendering

- **Old model (legacy)** — synchronous: updates block the main thread until completion.
- **Concurrent Rendering** — asynchronous and cooperative:
    - React can **break rendering into parts**,
    - **suspend** execution to respond to user actions,
    - **resume** or **cancel** work when more priority tasks appear.

Example:

```jsx
// Long rendering does not block the interface
startTransition(() => {
  setSearchQuery(inputValue);
});

```

React defers a low-priority state update to maintain responsiveness during text input.

---

### Suspense

- **Suspense** is a React mechanism that allows **deferring the render** of a component until data or resources are ready.
- Works together with Concurrent Rendering so as not to block the rest of the UI.

```jsx
const UserProfile = React.lazy(() => import('./UserProfile'));

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <UserProfile />
</Suspense>

```

- `fallback` is displayed until the component or data is loaded.
- You can nest multiple Suspense boundaries to isolate waiting zones.

---

### Integration with Data

React 18 supports **data-fetching Suspense** through libraries (React Query, Relay, SWR).

Example (with experimental API):

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <UserData id="42" />
</Suspense>

```

`UserData` "suspends" render until data is received, but other parts of the UI remain interactive.

---

### Priorities and Smoothness

- React itself distributes task priorities:
    - critical updates (input, clicks) — performed immediately,
    - secondary (loading, filtering) — can be suspended.
- This ensures **smooth interface operation without UI "freezing"**.

---

### Key ideas

- **Concurrent Rendering** = React's ability to perform work in parts.
- **Suspense** = declarative management of the waiting state.
- Both mechanisms are based on Fiber and support prioritization of updates.
- React remains responsive even during heavy renders or network delays.
