> `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` are React 18 hooks that implement cooperative rendering in concurrent mode.
> They allow deferring less priority updates so the interface remains responsive during input or data filtering.

### `useTransition`

- Allows **splitting updates by priority**:
    - urgent (input, clicks)
    - and deferred (list render, data request).
- Returns the array `[startTransition, isPending]`.
- Anything wrapped in `startTransition`, React considers a **non-priority task** and may perform later.

```jsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

function handleChange(e) {
  const value = e.target.value;
  setInput(value); // urgent update
  startTransition(() => {
    setFilteredItems(filterItems(value)); // low priority
  });
}

```

**Result:** the user sees an immediate reaction to input,
while filtering is performed asynchronously without blocking the UI.

---

### `useDeferredValue`

- Defers the application of a rapidly changing value (e.g., text input) to optimize performance.
- React "freezes" the old value until it finishes a heavy update.

```jsx
const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

const results = useMemo(
  () => filterLargeList(deferredQuery),
  [deferredQuery]
);

```

**Result:** with rapid input, the heavy list updates with a delay,
but the input field remains responsive.

### Difference between them

| Hook | What it does | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **useTransition** | Makes part of the code low-priority | When you need to manually mark deferred updates |
| **useDeferredValue** | Defers the use of a rapidly changing value | When a value changes frequently (input, slider, search) |

---

### Key ideas

- Both hooks use **Concurrent Rendering** for load balancing.
- `useTransition` — manual priority management; `useDeferredValue` — automatic value delay.
- They prevent interface "lag" during heavy updates.
- The main goal is to **maintain smooth UX** without blocking user actions.
