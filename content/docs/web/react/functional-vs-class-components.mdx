> React supports two types of components: functional and class-based.
> Both describe the UI but differ in how they manage state, lifecycle, and syntax.

### Functional Components

- Defined as **pure functions** taking `props` and returning JSX.
- Do not have their own `this` or class context.
- Manage state and side effects through **Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, etc.).
- Simpler, easier to test, support logic composition through **Custom Hooks**.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
  );
}

```

---

### Class Components

- Created using **ES6 classes** extending `React.Component`.
- Use lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.).
- Manage state through `this.state` and `this.setState()`.
- Have a `this` context and more complex syntax when working with callbacks and binding.

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 };
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
        {this.state.count}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

```

### Comparison

| Characteristic | Functional | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State Management | Hooks | `this.state` / `setState()` |
| Lifecycle | `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect` | lifecycle methods |
| `this` context | absent | binding required |
| Performance | slightly higher (fewer wrappers) | slightly heavier |
| Logic Reuse | via Custom Hooks | via HOC / Render Props |

---

### Key ideas

- **Hooks** made functional components a full replacement for class components.
- Today it is recommended to use **only functional components**.
- Classes remain in old codebases, but new React APIs are developed only for the functional approach.
