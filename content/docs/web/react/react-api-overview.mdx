> React API is based on three key concepts — JSX, Virtual DOM, and Components.
> Together they form a declarative model in which the UI is described as a function of state and updated efficiently and predictably.

### JSX

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)** — a syntactic extension of JavaScript that allows describing UI structure in a way that looks like XML code.
- During compilation, JSX is transformed into **`React.createElement()`** calls, which create React Element objects.
- These objects represent future nodes of the Virtual DOM, without creating real DOM elements until render.

```jsx
// JSX syntax:
const element = <h1>Hello, {user.name}</h1>;

// After Babel transpilation:
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  null,
  'Hello, ',
  user.name
);

```

- This approach combines the declarativeness of HTML and the power of JavaScript.
- JSX can be used inside expressions, loops, conditions, and functions.

### Virtual DOM

- **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM.
- With every state change, React creates a new tree of elements and compares it with the old one (diffing).
- Then the reconciliation engine updates only the changed nodes in the real DOM.
- This allows React to perform updates as efficiently as possible, avoiding a full page re-render.

### Components

- **Components** — the building blocks of a React application.
- Can be **functional** (via Hooks) or **class-based** (`extends React.Component`).
- Each component encapsulates logic, state, and markup.
- Components can be nested and reusable, forming the UI on the principle of composition.

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

```

### Key ideas

- **JSX** describes the UI declaratively and compiles to `React.createElement()`.
- **Virtual DOM** — an optimized layer that prevents unnecessary updates to the real DOM.
- **Components** — isolated and reusable interface elements.
- React combines them into a cohesive, performant rendering system.
