> React solves key problems in developing complex dynamic interfaces where synchronization of state and DOM is required.
> It offers a declarative model, component architecture, and a virtual DOM for predictable and performant UI updates.

### Essence of React

- React is a **declarative library** for building user interfaces.
- It eliminates manual DOM management, which leads to errors and reduces performance.
- It implements a **unidirectional data flow** — state determines the look of the interface, not the other way around.
- It allows breaking the interface into **components** that isolate logic, markup, and state.

### Problems React Solves

- **Imperative DOM updates** → replaced by the virtual DOM and the reconciliation mechanism.
- **Complexity of state and side effects** → solved through the component model and hooks.
- **Code duplication and weak reusability** → eliminated with isolated components.
- **Difficulty of debugging** → eliminated due to the deterministic data flow and predictability of the render.
- **Low performance** during multiple DOM updates → optimized through Virtual DOM diffing.

### Key ideas

- UI = a function of state (`UI = f(state)`).
- Virtual DOM minimizes operations with the real DOM.
- Components ensure reuse and isolation of logic.
- Unidirectional data flow makes application behavior predictable.
- React makes complex UI **deterministic, performant, and manageable**.
