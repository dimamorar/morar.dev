title: "Actions vs API Routes"
description: ""
---
Server Actions are direct server calls from React. API Routes are HTTP endpoints for external clients.
## Server Actions
- Run on the server without HTTP.
- Called via forms or direct imports.
- For internal mutations and UI workflows.
- Not publicly accessible; no client bundle JS.
- Full access to DB, cookies, and secrets.
## API Routes (Route Handlers)
- HTTP endpoints callable by any client.
- Use for external APIs, integrations, webhooks, mobile.
- Full HTTP surface: status, headers, CORS, streaming.
```js
export function POST(request) {
  return Response.json({ ok: true });
}
```
## Key differences
- Protocol: React vs HTTP.
- Access: internal UI vs public/external.
- Overhead: no fetch vs network request.
- Purpose: mutations vs integrations.
