Server Actions call server functions directly from components without API routes.
## Basics
- Declare with `"use server"`.
```js
"use server";
```
- Called via forms or direct imports.
- Runs on the server in an isolated context.
## Form handling
```jsx
<form action={updateUser}>
  <input name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```
- Data is serialized automatically.
- No API route, no client `fetch`, no form state boilerplate.
## Programmatic call
```js
import { updateUser } from "./actions";
await updateUser({ name: "John" });
```
## Advantages
- Less client JS, simpler mutations, full server access.
## Limitations
- No browser APIs.
- Client Components still required for interactive UI.
- Cache config matters; mutations can make routes dynamic.
