title: "Code Splitting"

Next.js splits code by route, segment, and component so the browser loads only what is needed.
## Automatic splitting
- Chunks created per `page.js`, layout, and Client Component.
- Loaded only when navigating to the related route.
## RSC impact
- Server Components never ship to the client bundle.
- Only Client Components and their deps are sent to the browser.
## Dynamic imports
```jsx
const Chart = dynamic(() => import("./Chart"), { ssr: false });
```
- Use to defer heavy components or browser-only libraries.
## Route separation
- Segments, layouts, and parallel routes get isolated bundles.
- Transitions fetch only required chunks.
## Advantages
- Smaller initial JS, faster hydration, efficient transitions.
