## **How code splitting works in Next.js**

> Code splitting in Next.js automatically splits the bundle into smaller parts so that the browser only loads the necessary code.  
> App Router uses RSC, dynamic imports, and isolation of Client Components, which minimizes the amount of JS on the client.  
> This increases performance, reduces hydration time, and speeds up the first render.

### Technical Explanation

#### Automatic Code Splitting

- Next.js splits code **by files**, **by route segments**, and **by the layout tree**.
    
- Each `page.js` and each Client Component has its own chunk.
    
- The bundle is loaded **only when navigating to the route** that the chunk concerns.

#### Code splitting thanks to RSC

- Server Components **do not end up** in the client bundle.
    
- Only Client Components and their dependent logic are loaded to the client.
    
- This radically reduces the volume of JS.
    

---

#### Dynamic Imports

- Used for deferred loading of components:
    

```jsx
const Chart = dynamic(() => import("./Chart"), { ssr: false });
```

- Allow not including heavy components in the main bundle.
    
- Can disable SSR (for example, for libraries that only work in the browser).

#### Route Separation

- App Router isolates bundles for:
    
    - each route segment;
        
    - layouts;
        
    - parallel segments (`@modal`, `@feed`).
        
- Upon transition, Next.js loads only the necessary chunks.

#### Advantages
- smaller initial JS;
- faster hydration;
- efficient transitions between pages;
- possibility of lazy loading heavy components.
