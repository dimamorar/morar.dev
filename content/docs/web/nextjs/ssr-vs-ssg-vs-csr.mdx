title: "SSR vs SSG vs CSR"

---
SSR, SSG, and CSR define where and when HTML is generated.
## SSR
- HTML rendered on the server per request.
- Best for personalization and fast-changing data.
- Good SEO, slower TTFB.
## SSG
- HTML generated at build time.
- Best for stable pages like marketing or docs.
- Very fast TTFB, but data is frozen until rebuild/ISR.
## CSR
- Server sends minimal HTML + JS; browser renders UI.
- Best for SPAs and private dashboards.
- SEO limited without JS execution; UI waits for JS.
## Quick comparison
- SSR: render on server every request.
- SSG: render once at build time.
- CSR: render in the browser.
