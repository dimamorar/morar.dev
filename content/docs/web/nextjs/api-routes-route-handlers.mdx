Route Handlers are API routes in App Router. They live in `app/api/.../route.js` and return HTTP responses.
## Basics
- Located in `app/api/.../route.js`.
- Server-only execution; secrets, DB, file system available.
- Export HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`.
```js
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ status: "ok" });
}
```
## Routing
- `app/api/users/route.js` → `/api/users`
- `app/api/products/[id]/route.js` → `/api/products/:id`
```js
export function GET(request, { params }) {
  return Response.json({ id: params.id });
}
```
## Runtime
- Node.js runtime or Edge runtime.
- Can use databases, `cookies()`, `headers()`, streaming responses.
## Caching
- Edge routes are cached by CDN unless disabled.
- Node routes are not cached by default.
- Control via `Cache-Control` headers.
## vs Server Actions
- Route Handlers are HTTP endpoints.
- Server Actions are direct server functions without HTTP.
