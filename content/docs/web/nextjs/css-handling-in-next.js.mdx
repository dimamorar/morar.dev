App Router supports global CSS, CSS Modules, Tailwind, and CSS-in-JS. Styles are built at compile time.
## Global CSS
- Import only in `app/layout.js`.
- Good for resets, variables, and shared utilities.
```jsx
import "./globals.css";
```
## CSS Modules
- File format: `component.module.css`.
- Scoped styles with generated class names.
```jsx
import styles from "./button.module.css";
```
## Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first; generated at build time.
- Common combo: Tailwind + CSS Modules or local styles.
## CSS-in-JS
- Supported, but only in Client Components.
- Use for dynamic styles based on state.
## Notes
- Styles do not add hydration overhead.
- Tailwind or CSS Modules keep client JS low.
