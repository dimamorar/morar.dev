title: "App Router vs Pages Router"
description: ""
---
App Router is server-first with RSC and segment layouts. Pages Router is client-first with `getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps`.
## App Router (`/app`)
- Built on React Server Components; server is the UI source.
- Segment files: `layout.js`, `page.js`, `loading.js`, `error.js`, `not-found.js`, `route.js`.
- Supports streaming, partial rendering, parallel and intercepting routes, Server Actions.
- Unified data fetching via `fetch()` with caching and revalidation.
- Smaller client JS and less hydration.
## Pages Router (`/pages`)
- Uses Client Components plus SSR/SSG via `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, `getInitialProps`.
- Global composition with `_app.js`, `_document.js`.
- No RSC, streaming, layout segments, or Server Actions.
- More hydration and larger bundles.
## Key differences
- App Router is server-first; Pages Router is client-first.
- App Router builds a layout tree; Pages Router uses a global shell.
- App Router automates caching; Pages Router does not.
