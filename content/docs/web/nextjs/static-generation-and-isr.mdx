App Router decides whether a page is static, dynamic, or revalidatable based on cache rules.
## Static rendering (SSG)
- Automatic when no dynamic params, no `no-store`, no cookies/headers.
- HTML + RSC payload generated at build time.
## ISR
- Background revalidation after a time window.
```js
export const revalidate = 60;
```
```js
fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 120 } });
```
## How ISR works
1. User gets cached version.
2. After `revalidate`, Next.js regenerates in background.
3. New version replaces old.
## Static fetch
- `fetch()` with `cache: "force-cache"` keeps data static.
- Caches: Data Cache, RSC Cache, Full-Route Cache.
## What makes a route dynamic
- `cache: "no-store"`
- cookies/headers
- `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
- dynamic params without pre-generation
## Summary
- `revalidate = N` → ISR
- no dynamics → SSG
- `no-store` → SSR
