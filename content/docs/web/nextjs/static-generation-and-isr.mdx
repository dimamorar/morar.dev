## **How static generation works in App Router (`revalidate`, ISR, static fetch)**

> App Router automatically determines whether a page is static, dynamic, or revalidatable.  
> Static pages are generated during build or updated in the background via ISR.  
> Cache policies are defined at the route level (`revalidate`) or at the `fetch` level.

### Technical Explanation

#### Static Rendering (SSG)

- Enabled automatically if:
    
    - the route has no dynamic parameters,
        
    - `fetch` does not contain `no-store`,
        
    - there is no access to cookies/headers.
        
- HTML + RSC payload is generated **during build**.
    
- Suitable for pages with stable data.

#### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- Allows Next.js to update static pages **in the background** after a certain time.
    
- Configured via:
    

##### 1. At the route level:

```js
export const revalidate = 60; // ISR every minute
```

##### 2. At the fetch level:

```js
fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 120 } });
```

#### How ISR Works

1. The user receives the **cached version**.
    
2. If the `revalidate` time has passed, Next.js triggers a background update.
    
3. The new version replaces the old one after generation.
    
4. No delays for the user.

#### Static Fetch

- Any `fetch()` in RSC with `cache: "force-cache"` makes the data static.
    
- All requests are cached separately:
    
    - Data Cache (fetch cache)
        
    - RSC Cache
        
    - Full-Route Cache
    

---

#### What makes a route dynamic

- `fetch({ cache: "no-store" })`
    
- dependency on cookies/headers
    
- `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
    
- dynamic parameters (without pre-generation)

### Summary of Behavior

- `revalidate = N` → ISR
    
- without `revalidate`, without dynamics → SSG
    
- `no-store` → SSR
    
- static fetch → SSG/ISR
