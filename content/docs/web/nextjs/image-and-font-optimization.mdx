Next.js optimizes images and fonts to improve performance and reduce layout shift.
## `next/image`
- Auto-selects formats (WebP/AVIF), responsive sizes, and lazy loading.
- Optimizes caching; reduces CLS with `width`/`height` or `fill`.
```jsx
import Image from "next/image";
<Image src="/hero.jpg" width={1200} height={600} alt="Hero" />
```
### Core features
- `priority` for LCP elements.
- `placeholder="blur"` for perceived speed.
- CDN caching on Vercel.
## `next/font`
- Removes Google Fonts network requests.
- Fonts are inlined or self-hosted; reduces FOIT/FOUT.
### APIs
- `next/font/google` (served locally).
- `next/font/local` (project fonts).
```js
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });
```
```jsx
<body className={inter.className}>...</body>
```
## Benefits
- Smaller CSS/JS, improved LCP/FCP, less CLS.
