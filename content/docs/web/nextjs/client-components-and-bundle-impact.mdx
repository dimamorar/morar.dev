Client Components are any components that require browser-only logic. They add JS to the client bundle and must hydrate.
## What makes a component a Client Component
- `"use client"` at the top of the file.
- React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useRef`.
- Browser APIs: `window`, `document`, `localStorage`.
- Event handlers like `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`.
## How Next.js decides
- Any file with `"use client"` in its module graph.
- Client Component importing a Server Component is invalid.
- Server Component importing a Client Component is allowed.
## Bundle impact
- Code ships to the client bundle and hydrates.
- More client components means more JS and slower TTI.
- Client Components are not cached like RSC.
## Minimal example
```jsx
"use client";
export default function Counter() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setValue(value + 1)}>{value}</button>;
}
```
