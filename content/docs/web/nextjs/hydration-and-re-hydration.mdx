Hydration connects client JS to server-rendered HTML. In App Router, only Client Components hydrate.
## Initial hydration
- After SSR/SSG, the browser gets HTML plus Client Component bundles.
- React binds events and reconciles the DOM.
- Server Components do not hydrate.
## Re-hydration
- Happens when a new RSC payload arrives after navigation or Suspense updates.
- Only affected parts update; layouts keep state.
## How App Router behaves
- Server sends serialized RSC fragments.
- Client updates hydrated and non-hydrated UI parts.
- Minimal JS; SPA-like transitions with server rendering.
## Key differences
- Hydration: first client run of Client Components.
- Re-hydration: partial updates after new RSC payload.
