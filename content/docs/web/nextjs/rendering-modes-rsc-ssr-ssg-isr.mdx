App Router uses RSC by default, and SSR/SSG/ISR are controlled by cache and data rules.
## RSC
- Default: server renders UI without hydration.
- Best for stable content and heavy server logic.
- Supports streaming via Suspense.
## SSR
- Renders on every request, no cache.
- Use for personalization or frequently changing data.
- Triggered by dynamic params, `cache: "no-store"`, or `dynamic = "force-dynamic"`.
## SSG
- Build-time render; cached HTML + RSC payload.
- Best for marketing, docs, blogs.
## ISR
- Background revalidation after `revalidate` window.
- Configure with `export const revalidate = N`.
## Quick guide
- RSC default, SSR for user-specific data, SSG for static pages, ISR for semi-dynamic.
