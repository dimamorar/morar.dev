App Router maps folders in `app/` to URL segments and builds a layout tree.
## Route segments
- `app/dashboard` → `/dashboard`
- `app/blog/[slug]` → `/blog/:slug`
- Each segment can include `page.js`, `layout.js`, `loading.js`, `error.js`, `not-found.js`.
## Nested layouts
- `app/layout.js` → `app/dashboard/layout.js` → `app/dashboard/settings/layout.js`.
- Layouts persist across transitions and preserve state.
- Good for shared UI: headers, sidebars, breadcrumbs.
## Dynamic and catch-all routes
- `[id]` or `[slug]` for dynamic params.
- `[...slug]` for any depth.
- `[[...slug]]` also matches the root.
## Special routing features
- Parallel segments (`@modal`, `@feed`) render in parallel.
- Intercepting routes (`(.)`, `(..)`, `(...)`) enable modal routes.
- Route Handlers (`route.js`) provide API endpoints.
