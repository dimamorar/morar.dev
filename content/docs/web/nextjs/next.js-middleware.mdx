title: "Middleware"
description: ""
---
Middleware runs before a request is completed. It executes on the Edge Runtime and can rewrite, redirect, and protect routes.
## Basics
- File at project root: `middleware.js`.
- Runs before routes, RSC rendering, and Route Handlers.
- Edge-only; no Node APIs.
```js
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
export function middleware(request) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```
## Use cases
- Auth checks and redirects.
```js
if (!isAuthenticated) return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
```
- Rewrites/redirects, i18n routing, feature flags, A/B tests.
- Page protection and bot blocking.
## Matcher
```js
export const config = { matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*"] };
```
## Limitations
- No direct DB access, no Node APIs, no server-only libraries.
