> `unknown` is a safer alternative to `any` that denotes a value of an unknown type.
> It should be used when the type is not yet defined, but you want to **maintain type safety** and not lose control over checks.

### 🧩 Main Idea

- Any value can be assigned to a variable of type `unknown`.
- But using it (accessing properties, calling methods) is **impossible without a type check**.
- This forces the developer to **explicitly refine the type** before working with the data.

```tsx
let value: unknown = "Hello";

value.toUpperCase(); // ❌ Error — type unknown

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // ✅ Safe
}
```

### 🧩 Comparison with `any`

| Property | `any` | `unknown` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can assign anything | ✅ | ✅ |
| Can call methods without check | ✅ | ❌ |
| Checked by compiler | ❌ | ✅ |

`unknown` requires additional type checks, preventing most runtime errors.

### 🧩 Typical Use Cases

- Working with **dynamic data** (e.g., result of `JSON.parse`, data from an API).
- Functions that can return **different types** depending on conditions.
- In generic types when the argument type is not yet determined.

```tsx
function parseData(input: string): unknown {
  return JSON.parse(input);
}
```

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `unknown` preserves the flexibility of `any`, but **forces type checking**.
- It is better to use `unknown` when you don't know the type yet but want to stay within the type system.
- `any` is "TypeScript turned off," while `unknown` is **controlled chaos**.
