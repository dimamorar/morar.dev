> Access modifiers in TypeScript control the accessibility of class properties and methods. They determine which parts of the code can access a specific class member, helping to implement **encapsulation** — one of the key principles of OOP.

### 🧩 `public` (default)

- Accessible **everywhere** — inside the class, in its descendants, and outside.
- If no modifier is specified, the property or method is considered `public`.

```tsx
class User {
  public name: string = "Olha";
}

const user = new User();
console.log(user.name); // ✅ accessible
```

---

### 🧩 `private`

- Accessible only **inside the same class**.
- Inaccessible from the outside or in descendant classes.

```tsx
class Account {
  private balance: number = 1000;

  private getBalance() {
    return this.balance;
  }
}

const acc = new Account();
acc.balance;      // ❌ Error
acc.getBalance(); // ❌ Error
```

---

### 🧩 `protected`

- Accessible **within the class and its descendants**, but **not from the outside**.
- Used when a subclass should have access to certain properties of the parent class.

```tsx
class Base {
  protected id: number = 1;
}

class Derived extends Base {
  showId() {
    console.log(this.id); // ✅ allowed
  }
}

const d = new Derived();
d.id; // ❌ Error
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `public` → full access.
- `private` → only inside the same class.
- `protected` → inside the class and its descendants.
- Access modifiers are applied only at the compilation stage — **they do not exist in JavaScript**, but they ensure type safety and a clear architecture.
