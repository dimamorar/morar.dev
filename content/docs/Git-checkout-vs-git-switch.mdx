> `git switch` is a modern alternative to some of the functions of `git checkout`, designed for clarity.

### Explanation

- `git checkout` — a universal command: it can switch branches **and** restore files.
- `git switch` — only for switching branches (`git switch feature/login`).
- `git restore` — for restoring files (`git restore index.js`).

Thus, Git divided the `checkout` behavior to increase readability and safety.
