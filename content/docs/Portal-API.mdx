## Portal API — rendering outside root DOM tree

> Portal API allows rendering React components outside the root container while preserving the overall context and event connection.
> 
> This is a solution for displaying elements on top of the main tree, such as modals, popups, or tooltips.

### 🧩 What is a Portal

- **A Portal** creates a "tunnel" between the React tree and any other DOM node.
- The component is visually rendered outside the parent container but logically remains its child element in the React tree.
- This allows, for example, inserting modal windows into `<body>`, avoiding problems with styles and `z-index`.

---

### 🧩 Creating a Portal

The function `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)` is used — it returns a React element that renders `child` into `container`.

```jsx
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

function Modal({ children }) {
  const modalRoot = document.getElementById('modal-root');
  return createPortal(children, modalRoot);
}
```

**HTML:**

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<div id="modal-root"></div>
```

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Modal>
  <Dialog />
</Modal>
```

### 🧩 Events and Context

- Although the node is physically in a different place in the DOM, events (e.g., `onClick`) continue to **bubble up to React parent components**.

- Context (`Context API`) and state remain accessible as if the element were in a regular React tree.

---

### 🧩 Typical Use Cases

- Modal windows (`Modal`, `Dialog`)
- Context menus and popup panels (`Popover`, `Tooltip`)
- Global notifications (`Toast`)
- Overlay components that overlap the main content

---

### 💡 Key Ideas

- **Portal = a separate render point in the DOM** without losing logical connection with the React tree.
- Implemented via `createPortal(child, container)`.
- Preserves event bubbling and access to context.
- Used for UI elements that require rendering outside the main document flow.
