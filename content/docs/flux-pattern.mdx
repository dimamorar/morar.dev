## Flux Pattern

> Flux is an architectural pattern based on a **strictly unidirectional data flow** and separation of responsibility between Action, Dispatcher, Store, and View.  
> It was created as a response to the chaos of two-way connections in MVC and provides predictable state updates in complex UI applications.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Core Idea**

- All state changes pass through one controlled chain.
    
- No direct UI → state or state → UI updates.
    
- Each part of the pattern is responsible for only one role.
    

#### **Flux Components**

##### **Action**

- A formalized description of the intent to change the state.
    
- Contains `type` and `payload`.
    
- Initiated by the View or a system event.
    

##### **Dispatcher**

- The central router for all actions.
    
- Passes the action to each registered Store.
    
- Guarantees the sequence of processing.
    

##### **Store**

- Stores the state of a specific domain area.
    
- Contains the business logic for updating the state upon receiving an action.
    
- Notifies the View after the state changes.
    

##### **View**

- The UI layer of the application.
    
- Subscribes to the Store, receives the state, and displays it.
    
- Initiates Actions in response to user events.
    

#### **Why Flux emerged**

- Two-way connections in MVC created unpredictable updates.
    
- It was difficult to understand what caused the change.
    
- Flux introduces a transparent, deterministic update path.

### Important Notes

- Flux is not a framework, but an architectural idea.
    
- Redux is a simplified implementation of the same principles, but **without a Dispatcher**.
    
- Store in Flux contains business logic, while in Redux this role is performed by the Reducer.
