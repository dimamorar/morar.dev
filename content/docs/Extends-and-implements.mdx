> extends and implements are two TypeScript mechanisms that define inheritance and implementation of interfaces or classes. `extends` is used for **inheriting implementation**, while `implements` is used for **adhering to a type contract**.

---

### 🧩 `extends` — Inheritance

- Used when a **class inherits another class** or an **interface inherits another interface**.
- The child class receives **all properties and methods of the parent class**, and can override or extend them.

```tsx
class Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("Moving...");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

const rex = new Dog();
rex.move(); // ✅ inherited
rex.bark(); // ✅ own method
```

- You can inherit only **one class**, but **multiple interfaces**.

---

### 🧩 `implements` — Contract Implementation

- Used when a class **commits to implementing an interface**.
- Provides correspondence of form (structure), but **does not provide a ready-made implementation**.

```tsx
interface Flyable {
  fly(): void;
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
  fly() {
    console.log("Flying...");
  }
}
```

- If a class does not implement all methods of the interface — the compiler issues an error.

---

### 🧩 Combination

You can simultaneously **inherit a class** and **implement interfaces**:

```tsx
class Eagle extends Bird implements Flyable {
  fly() {
    console.log("Soaring high...");
  }
}
```

### 💡 Key Ideas

- `extends` → **inherits implementation** from another class or interface.
- `implements` → **guarantees contract compliance**, but does not provide code.
- `extends` = "get behavior",
    
    `implements` = "follow structure".
