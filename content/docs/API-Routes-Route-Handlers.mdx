## **How API Routes work in App Router (`app/api/.../route.js`)**

> In App Router, API routes are implemented via Route Handlers — `route.js` files that return HTTP responses.  
> They allow creating backend endpoints without a separate server and run in a server environment.  
> Route Handlers integrate with middleware, cache, and can be dynamic depending on the directory structure.

### Technical Explanation

#### Route Handlers Basics

- Located in `app/api/.../route.js`.
    
- Run **exclusively on the server** — secrets, databases, file system are available.
    
- Have separate HTTP methods as exported functions:
    
    - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`.
    

**Minimal GET example:**

```js
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ status: "ok" });
}
```

#### Routing

- The directory defines the path:
    
    - `app/api/users/route.js` → `/api/users`
        
    - `app/api/products/[id]/route.js` → `/api/products/:id`
        
- Parameters are available via:
    

```js
export function GET(request, { params }) {
  return Response.json({ id: params.id });
}
```

#### Server Environment

- Executes in **Node.js runtime or Edge runtime** (at your choice).
    
- You can use:
    
    - databases (Prisma, Mongo, Postgres),
        
    - cookies (`cookies()`),
        
    - headers (`headers()`),
        
    - streaming responses.
    

---

#### Caching in Route Handlers

- Edge runtime is cached by CDN (unless disabled).
    
- Node runtime — non-cached by default.
    
- Can be controlled via `Cache-Control` headers.

#### Route Handler vs Server Actions

- Route Handlers are the **HTTP API layer**.
    
- Server Actions are **direct functions** called from a component without HTTP.
