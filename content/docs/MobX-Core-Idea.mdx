## MobX: Core Idea

> MobX is a reactive library for state management that uses **observable data**, **computed values**, and **reactions**, automatically synchronizing state and UI.  
> Its main principle: _"minimum code — maximum reactivity"_.

### Technical Explanation

#### **Reactivity as the basis**

- Data becomes **observable** — MobX tracks who reads them.
    
- When an observable changes, MobX automatically updates all dependent calculations and components.
    
- You do not need to manually call `dispatch`, create reducers, or immutable copies.
    

#### **Three key primitives**

1. **observable** — state that MobX tracks
    
2. **computed** — a value that is cached and reacts only to relevant changes
    
3. **reaction** — side logic that runs automatically
    

#### **Approach "mutable state + tracking"**

Unlike Redux:

- MobX **allows mutations directly** (`store.count++`).
    
- Does not use immutable patterns.
    
- Maintains a _dependency graph_ and knows exactly what needs to be re-rendered.
    

#### **How UI updates**

Components (for example, React components with `observer`) become reactive:

- if the component reads an observable — MobX subscribes it to updates
    
- when the observable changes, MobX re-renders only components that depend on this data
    

This is very efficient and reminds of the way Signals work.

### Important Notes
- MobX is not a Flux/Redux approach; it is a reactive model, not a one-way flow.
- Mutations are allowed, but MobX fully controls "when and what to re-render".
- Very well suited for complex forms, authorization, rich-client UI, pages with a large number of related states.
