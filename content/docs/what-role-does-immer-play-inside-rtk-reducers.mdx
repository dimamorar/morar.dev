## What Role Does Immer Play Inside RTK Reducers

> Immer is a library that allows writing "mutation" code in reducers, but under the hood, it guarantees the creation of a new immutable state.  
> In Redux Toolkit, Immer completely eliminates the risks of dangerous mutations and makes reducers shorter and safer.

### Technical Explanation

#### **The Core Idea of Immer**

- You write code as if you are modifying an object directly.
    
- Immer creates a _draft_ copy of the state.
    
- All changes are applied to the draft.
    
- On exit, Immer forms a new immutable state object.
    

Thus:

- the syntax is simple (like mutation),
    
- the behavior is safe (immutable).
    

#### **Why Immer is needed in Redux**

Redux requires:

- never mutate the state,
    
- always return a new object,
    
- maintain the predictability of pure reducer functions.
    

Without Immer, complex nested updates look like this:

```js
return {
  ...state,
  user: {
    ...state.user,
    profile: {
      ...state.user.profile,
      name: 'Alex'
    }
  }
}
```

With Immer in RTK:

```js
state.user.profile.name = 'Alex'
```

Under the hood, a new immutable state is still created.

#### **Advantages of Immer in RTK**

- **Simplifies complex updates.**
    
- **Reduces mutation risks to zero.**
    
- **Improves the readability of reducers.**
    
- **Works naturally with `createSlice`.**
    
- **Preserves Redux optimizations**, because the new state is created correctly.
    

#### **Immer Does Not Violate Redux Principles**

Although the reducer looks "mutational,"  
in reality:

- the reducer remains a pure function,
    
- the state remains immutable,
    
- the logic of Redux principles is not violated.

### Important Notes

- Immer is activated in RTK **by default**.
- At any time, you can return to classic immutable updates (return a new object).
- Immer builds a tree of changes — so it is efficient even for complex structures.
