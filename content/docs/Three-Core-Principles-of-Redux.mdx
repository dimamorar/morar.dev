## Three Core Principles of Redux

> Redux is based on three fundamental principles that provide predictability and transparency of state management: single source of truth, state is read-only, and changes are made via pure functions.  
> These principles make Redux deterministic and easy to debug even in large applications.

### Technical Explanation

#### **1. Single Source of Truth**

- All global state is stored in a single object within a single Store.
    
- Components do not store their own copies of data and receive state from a centralized location.
    
- This simplifies interface synchronization and makes state consistent.
    

#### **2. State Is Read-Only**

- You cannot change state directly: no mutation of objects or arrays bypassing Redux.
    
- The only way to initiate a change is to call `dispatch(action)`.
    
- This eliminates implicit side effects and guarantees a controlled data flow.
    

#### **3. Changes Are Made With Pure Functions**

- Reducers are pure functions `(state, action) → newState`.
    
- They do not change the incoming state, do not perform side effects, and always return a new object.
    
- Thanks to this, Redux behaves deterministically: the same action always leads to the same result.

### Important Notes

- The second and third principles are closely related to immutability: only immutable data allows for correct change tracking.
    
- These principles form the basis for time-travel debugging, hot reload, and rendering optimizations in React.
    
- Middleware and Redux Toolkit extend Redux but do not violate these three rules.
