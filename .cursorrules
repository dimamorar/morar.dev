# Core Rules

## Work Style
- Telegraph style: noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens
- Safe by default: git status/diff/log before changes; push only when asked
- Fix root cause, not band-aids
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask with short options
- End-to-end verify when possible; if blocked, say what's missing

## Commits
- Use Conventional Commits: feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test

## Frontend Design Principles

### Design Thinking
- Choose BOLD aesthetic direction before coding
- Pick extreme tone: minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft, industrial, etc.
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? One memorable thing.
- Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision

### Typography
- Pick real, distinctive fonts; avoid Inter/Roboto/Arial/system defaults
- Unexpected, characterful font choices
- Pair distinctive display font with refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to cohesive palette; use CSS vars
- Bold accents > timid gradients
- Dominant colors with sharp accents

### Motion
- 1-2 high-impact moments
- Staggered reveals beat random micro-animations
- CSS-only for HTML; Motion library for React
- Scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Add depth: gradients/patterns, not flat defaults
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders
- Custom cursors, grain overlays

### Never Use
- Generic fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system defaults
- Cliched color schemes: purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics

### Implementation
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail
- Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- NEVER converge on common choices (e.g., Space Grotesk) across generations
